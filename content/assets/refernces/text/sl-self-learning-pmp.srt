1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hello, and welcome to the course overview of project management professional or PMP certification course.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Before we start, let's see what PMI or Project Management Institute is.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Project Management Institute PMI is the world's leading association for those who consider project, program, or portfolio management their profession.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Through global advocacy, collaboration, education, and research, we work to prepare more than 3 million professionals around the world for the project economy, the coming economy in which work and individuals are organized around projects.

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:11,000
PMI conducted a global practice analysis market research study, which produced a number of trends in the profession. Previously, unaddressed in the PMP exam, these trends were used as inputs into the job task analysis to ensure the validity and relevance of the PMP examination.

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Validation assures the outcome of the exam is, in fact, measuring and evaluating appropriately the specific knowledge and skills required to function as a project management practitioner.

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Thus, the job task analysis guarantees that each examination validly measures all elements of the project management profession in terms of a real life setting.

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Let's now understand what project management professional or PMP is. It is one of the certifications awarded by PMI.

9
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It is an industry recognized credential and is valid across the globe. It is a recognized certification that accelerates your career and gives you a competitive edge.

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It is an important industry recognized certification for project managers.

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:14,000
PMP delivers value far into your career. The CIO magazine ranks the PMP certification as the top project management certification because it proves you have the specific skills and experience employers seek.

12
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Certified PMPs reported earning up to 25% more than non-certified project management professionals.

13
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:42,000
PMP certification is not restricted to a specific domain. A project manager working in any industry, such as manufacturing, retail, defense or information technology, can write the PMP exam and upon successful completion. Be a PMP certified professional.

14
00:02:42,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This course is designed for individuals who have on-the-job project management experience regardless of whether their formal job role is as a project manager for those who are not certified professionals and those who might or might not have received formal project management training.

15
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Before you apply, make sure you meet of the following sets of PMP certification requirements. A four-year degree, 36 months leading projects, 35 hours of project management education or training, or CAPN certification, or the high school diploma or an associate's degree, or globally equivalent, 60 months leading projects,

16
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:38,000
35 hours of project management education training or CAPN certification. The examination content outline, or ECO, is the most radical change to the exam in more than 20 years.

17
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It changes the test domains from the five process groups of initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing to three completely different domains titled People, Process and Business Environment.

18
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The PMP examination content outline, ECO documents the domains, tasks and enablers that are addressed in the PMP certification exam. Let's look at each of them in detail.

19
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Domains referred to the high-level knowledge area essential to the practice of project management. Tasks are the underlying responsibilities of the project manager within each domain area.

20
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Enablers are illustrative examples of the work associated with the task. The PMP exam content outline, or ECO, will be based on three domains, People, Process and Business Environment. Let's look at each of them.

21
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:46,000
People domain emphasizes the skills and activities associated with effectively leading a project team. Process domain reinforces the technical aspects of managing a project.

22
00:04:46,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Business Environment domain highlights the connection between projects and organizational strategy. Content that spans the value delivery spectrum, including predictive, agile and hybrid approaches, will be included across the three exam domains.

23
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Let us look at the percentages of questions from each domain. People domain will include 42% of the questions. Process domain comprises 50% of the questions, and Business Environment domain consists of 8% of the questions.

24
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Now that we know what domains, tasks and enablers are, we will look at examples of tasks and enablers within the people domain.

25
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:48,000
In this example, the task is to manage conflict. The enablers for this task are interpreting the source and stage of the conflict, analyzing the context for the conflict and evaluating, recommending or reconciling the appropriate conflict resolution solution,

26
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:59,000
as discussed earlier, there are 14 tasks in the people domain, and all the tasks are shown on the screen. These tasks help to build an efficient and high-performing team.

27
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The process domain has 17 tasks, and they are shown here. These tasks make process management easier and reduce the risks and defects in a process.

28
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:22,000
There are four tasks in the Business Environment domain, as shown on the screen. These tasks help an organization create and deliver value as efficiently as possible in their environment.

29
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Let us now look at the course outline. There are six topics in this course. They are, Business Environment, Lead the project team. Start the project, support project team performance, plan the project, close the project or phase.

30
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:50,000
With this course from Simply Learn, you will get self-paced videos. You will also get access to case studies that will give you real-world examples of the concepts covered in this course.

31
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You will also have access to assessments that will test the knowledge you will gain throughout the course. Let us now move on to the exam pattern.

32
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The P&P exam comprises 180 questions in total. Of the 180 questions, 175 are scored, and 5 are considered pre-test or unscored questions.

33
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Pre-test questions do not affect the score, and are used in the examination as an effective and legitimate way to test the validity of future examination questions.

34
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
All questions are randomly placed throughout the examination. Let us look at the question types.

35
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Questions will be a combination of multiple choice, multiple responses, matching, hotspot and limited fill in the blanks.

36
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The allotted time to complete. The examination is 230 minutes. It may take some candidates less than the allotted time to complete the examination.

37
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You will have a total of two 10-minute breaks for computer-based exam. Please note that there are no scheduled breaks for paper-based exam.

38
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The examination is preceded by a tutorial and followed by a survey, both of which are optional and which take 5 to 15 minutes to complete.

39
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The time used to complete the tutorial and survey is not included in the examination time.

40
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Last but not the least, let us look at how PMI scores the exam. There is no negative marking.

41
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:34,000
PMI does not give a pass percentage for the exam. The results will be based on proficiency level, that is above target, meaning target, below target and needs improvement.

42
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Let's look at the list of references for the PMP examination.

43
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,000
PMP exam is not written according to any single text or singularly supported by any particular reference.

44
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:56,000
PMI does not endorse specific review courses, resources, references or other materials to prepare for the exam.

45
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:07,000
As the PMP is a competency-based certification, which assesses the integrated set of knowledge, skills, and abilities gained from both practical and learned experiences.

46
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It should also be noted that the references identified herewith are but one element of a broader set of educational resources and texts that might possibly be utilized for exam and study preparation.

47
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
This reference list is provided only as a courtesy for the non-PMI publications on this list.

48
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,000
PMI does not endorse such publications or warrant the accuracy of the information or opinions contained therein.

49
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The PMBock Guide is as one of the references for the PMP exam.

50
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The other references are shown here.

51
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Let's get started!

52
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The PMP exam is not written according to any single text or singularly supported by any particular reference.

53
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The PMP exam is provided only as a courtesy for the PMP exam.

54
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The PMP exam is provided only as a courtesy for the PMP exam.

55
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The PMP exam is provided only as a courtesy for the PMP exam.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's look at the foundational concepts of project management.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's first look at what is a project.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
According to the PIMBOK Guide, a project is a temporary endeavor

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Temporary means that a project has definite start and end dates.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Projects are taken up for a definite period to create value, drive change,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and deliver business value.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Here are a few examples of projects developing a new product,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
constructing a building, merging two organizations,

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
developing a new software application, erecting and commissioning a manufacturing plant,

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
upgrading an existing product, developing a new service.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Temporary projects come to an end when the objectives have been met,

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
or the objectives can no longer be met to defectors such as,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
lack of a business need, unavailability of funding,

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
changes in organizational priorities or strategy, changes in the external environment,

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
the project is aborted or forcefully closed when the objectives can no longer be met.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Let us talk about the critical success factors of a project.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The success of a project depends on several factors, including,

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
definition of the core problem and the needs of the project,

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
the organization's ability and maturity in project management,

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
availability of resources, skill levels of the team members,

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
availability of funding, and collaboration and communication

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
among project stakeholders.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Successful project management includes understanding project management concepts

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and being able to adapt and apply them to the individual project.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's now look at the factors leading to the failure of projects.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Research has identified the following top reasons for project failures,

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
ambiguous, misunderstood or incorrect requirements,

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
lack of control over project costs and schedules,

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
scoop creep, minimal involvement of sponsors in the project strategy and direction,

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
not existent, out-of-date, incomplete or poorly constructed project plan,

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
frequently changing project managers, unclear responsibilities and relationships

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
among project teams, both internal and external,

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
lack of clarity regarding project benefits and deliverables,

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
poor or no-change control, inappropriate or insufficient skills.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Let us take a look at project life cycles and their development approach.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
In a broad sense, there are three methodologies for project management.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The predictive or planned-driven method often referred to as the traditional waterfall approach.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The agile method, a more modern and adaptive approach.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The hybrid method, which combines elements of both waterfall and agile approaches.

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The predictive or planned-driven approach is also referred to as the waterfall life cycle.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
This approach is taken in those projects where the requirements are predetermined

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and are not likely to change as changes may increase costs significantly.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
An example of the predictive or planned-driven approach is the construction of an apartment complex.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The project manager plays a crucial role in ensuring a successful project.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
When the project is completed, the deliverables are transitioned to the customer

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
and the value is realized both in the short and long term.

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
An agile approach is recommended in those complex projects where the end product is not known

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
and there could be frequent changes.

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The coordination of the customer and the team drives the project forward.

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
An example of an agile approach is a pharmaceutical research project or a project to develop software.

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The product owner controls the value proposition and delivery.

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The team works on and delivers the product or solution.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The scrum master or agile coach facilitates throughout the cycle.

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
A hybrid approach is a combination of waterfall and agile approaches.

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This approach is recommended in projects where some requirements are known and fixed

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
in certain areas of the project, while new methods or techniques could be tried in other areas

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
within the same project.

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The team might switch approaches based on the changing work requirements or circumstances.

60
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Projects can be predominantly predictive while using some agile components or predominantly agile

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
using some predictive components.

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
An example of a hybrid approach is designing a spacecraft.

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Let's now understand what a development lifecycle means.

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and build high-quality products.

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The development of a product in a project can follow a predictive lifecycle, an iterative lifecycle,

67
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:35,000
an incremental lifecycle, an adaptive lifecycle, and a hybrid lifecycle, a predictive lifecycle.

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Here, the project scope, time, and cost are determined as early as possible.

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The changes to the project scope are carefully managed.

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It is also referred to as the waterfall lifecycle.

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
An iterative lifecycle.

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
In this model, the scope is determined earlier, but the time at cost estimates are regularly modified

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
as the understanding of the product increases.

74
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
An incremental lifecycle.

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Here, the deliverable is produced through a series of iterations that successfully add functionality.

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
An adaptive lifecycle.

77
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Here, projects can be agile, iterative, or incremental.

78
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The scope is defined and approved before the start of an iteration.

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It is also referred to as agile or change-driven lifecycle.

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The iterations are rapid and have fixed duration and cost.

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
A hybrid lifecycle.

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
A hybrid lifecycle is a combination of a predictive and an adaptive lifecycle.

83
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
How does the iterative and incremental approach help?

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
These involve phases that are intentionally repeated as the team keeps on knowing their deliverables better.

85
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It is a good practice to use iterative and incremental practices throughout the project lifecycle,

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
as it will help the project team to increase the clarity in requirements,

87
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
make estimates more accurate and reduce risks.

88
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Let us explore the concept of a project management office.

89
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:25,000
A project management office, PMO, is an organizational structure that standardizes project-related governance processes

90
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
and facilitates the sharing of resources, methodologies, tools, and techniques.

91
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The three types of PMO are supportive, controlling, and directive.

92
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The supportive PMO's focus on developing best practices, methodologies, standards, and templates.

93
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
They also coach mentor, train, and guide project managers.

94
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Whereas, controlling PMOs are responsible for monitoring compliance with project management standards,

95
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
policies, procedures, and templates through project audits.

96
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Likewise, directive PMOs manage shared resources and facilitate communication between various projects.

97
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Remember that the level of control varies depending on the type of PMO structure in organizations.

98
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The supportive PMO involves low control, the controlling PMO involves medium control,

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and the directive PMO involves high control.

100
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Furthermore, some organizations have agile centers of excellence, also known as value delivery office.

101
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The role of an agile centers of excellence is to enable the project teams by coaching and mentoring,

102
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:53,000
rather than managing them, and build agile mindset, skills, and capabilities throughout the organization.

103
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Let's understand what organizational project management or OPM means.

104
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,000
OPM is a strategy execution framework that coordinates project, program, portfolio, and operations management,

105
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and which enables organizations to deliver a strategy.

106
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Project management enables the achievement of organizational goals and objectives.

107
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Program management harmonizes its program components, and controls interdependencies to realize specified benefits.

108
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Portfolio management aligns portfolios with organizational strategies by selecting the right programs or projects,

109
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
prioritizing the work, and providing the needed resources.

110
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And finally, operations management includes an organization's day-to-day operations,

111
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and when all the above are strategically managed, they combine to create OPM.

112
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Let us now understand the relationship between projects, programs, and portfolios.

113
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
According to the Project Management Institute, a guide to the project management body of knowledge,

114
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:20,000
PIMBOK Guide, Sixth Edition, a program is a group of related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities that are managed in a

115
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:35,000
coordinated manner to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually.

116
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:46,000
A portfolio is a collection of projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations managed as a group to achieve strategic objectives.

117
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The image here shows the relation between portfolios, programs, and projects.

118
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
A portfolio represents a portion of an organization's overall strategy.

119
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The strategic goals are cascaded down to lower-level components.

120
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:12,000
A portfolio may contain programs, projects, and also other work.

121
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Let's explore the concept of organizational structures.

122
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Let us now understand how an organizational structure affects a project.

123
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The organizational structure plays a critical role in determining how different groups and individuals within the organization interact.

124
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It also impacts the authority of the project manager, resource availability, and the way the projects are carried out.

125
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Let's examine the various types of organizational structures, including functional structure, matrix structure, project-oriented structure, and composite structure.

126
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Let us start with the functional structure.

127
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Organizations with a functional structure share the following characteristics.

128
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Resources are grouped based on carrying out specific, similar sets of activities.

129
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Reporting is hierarchical, with individuals reporting to their functional head, the functional manager.

130
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The project manager has lower authority compared to the functional manager.

131
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
In a matrix structure, resources are drawn from other functional areas.

132
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:31,000
They report to multiple managers, the functional manager, their resource manager, and possibly to the project manager.

133
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The structure may be characterized as weak, balanced, or strong, depending on the relative authority of the project manager to the functional manager.

134
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The project-oriented structure is characterized by the project manager and a core project team that operate as a separate organizational unit within the parent organization.

135
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Resources are 100% dedicated to the project and report to the project manager.

136
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The project manager has a significant amount of authority and independence.

137
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:16,000
All organizational structures, including functional, matrix, and project-oriented structures at various levels of an organization, are considered composite structures.

138
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Now, let us look into the project management principles.

139
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The project management institute has articulated 12 principles in the standard for project management.

140
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:43,000
A guide to the project management body of knowledge, Pinbock Guide, 7th addition to provide broad parameters within which project teams can operate.

141
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
These principles are a fundamental part of PMI's framework for project management.

142
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Let's now take a closer look at the 12 principles of project management institute.

143
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Be a diligent, respectful, and caring steward.

144
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Recognize, evaluate, and respond to system interactions.

145
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Navigate complexity. Create a collaborative project team environment.

146
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Demonstrate leadership behaviors. Optimize risk responses.

147
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Effectively engage with stakeholders. Taylor based on context.

148
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Embrace adaptability and resiliency. Focus on value.

149
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Build quality into processes and deliverables. And enable change to achieve the envisioned future state.

150
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Let's get an insight into different performance domains.

151
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:48,000
A project performance domain is a group of related activities that are critical for the effective delivery of project outcomes.

152
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:58,000
According to the Pinbock Guide, 7th addition, as the performance domains interact and react to each other, change occurs.

153
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
There are eight performance domains that include stakeholders, team, development approach, and life cycle.

154
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Planning, project work, delivery, measurement, and uncertainty.

155
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
In the stakeholders domain, a conducive working relationship with stakeholders is established.

156
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Stakeholder relationships are beneficial for the project.

157
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Stakeholders agree with project objectives, and there is a shared understanding.

158
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
In the team domain, team has a shared ownership.

159
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Team is high performing. Every team member has good leadership and interpersonal skills.

160
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,000
In development approach and life cycle domain, approach is consistent with deliverables of the project.

161
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Project delivers value for business and stakeholders throughout the project.

162
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Approach follows a delivery cadence for the project deliverables.

163
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
In the planning domain, the project is well organized and coordinated.

164
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The project plan takes an integrated approach to achieve the desired outcomes.

165
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Progressive elaboration produces the project's deliverables and outcomes, and the plans are responsive to change.

166
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:20,000
In the project work domain, the aim is to make performance efficient and effective.

167
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
This involves using processes that are suitable for the specific project and its context.

168
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Other areas, such as open and appropriate communication with stakeholders, efficient management of physical resources,

169
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
and effective handling of procurements are also emphasized.

170
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:47,000
To further enhance projects, the focus turns to improving the team's capabilities through continuous learning and process refinement.

171
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
When it comes to the delivery domain, the major points of focus are,

172
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
the project is aligned with business objectives and strategic outcomes,

173
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:05,000
the project delivers the planned output, the results and benefits are achieved within the time frame that has been specified before.

174
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Requirements are well understood by the project team and the stakeholders accept the deliverables and are satisfied with project outcomes.

175
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
In the measurement domain, performance is measured periodically to reflect the true status of the project.

176
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Work performance data is collected regularly to help in decision making.

177
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Timely interventions and decisions are taken to keep the project performance on track.

178
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Reliable forecasts and reports are used to achieve the intended outcomes of the project.

179
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
In the uncertainty domain, monitor the project environment using frameworks like pestle and vuka,

180
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
proactively identify and respond to uncertainty, anticipate threats and mitigate them,

181
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
leverage opportunities and harness them to improve performance.

182
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Manage issues effectively.

183
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
This topic will introduce you to tailoring projects to context.

184
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:17,000
According to the PIMBOC Guide 7th edition, tailoring is the deliberate adaptation of the project management approach,

185
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
governance and processes to make them more suitable for the given environment and the work at hand.

186
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It is important to understand that tailoring is done to align with the organization, project needs,

187
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,000
the business environment and to benefit the project, its stakeholders and support the intended outcomes.

188
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
What aspects of the project can be tailored?

189
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
According to the PIMBOC Guide 7th edition, project aspects that can be tailored include

190
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:55,000
life cycle and development approach selection, processes, engagement, tools, methods and artifacts.

191
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
This topic will introduce you to the Agile Manifesto and its principles.

192
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:13,000
In 2001, a group of software developers released the Agile Manifesto, serving as the foundation for various methodologies.

193
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:22,000
The original Agile Manifesto is composed of four foundational values that were mainly applied to software development.

194
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The four foundational values include individuals and interaction over process and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation,

195
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:41,000
customer collaboration over contract negotiation and responding to change over following a plan.

196
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Let's now take a closer look at the 12 principles of Agile.

197
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,000
The highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

198
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.

199
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

200
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Deliver working software frequently from a couple of weeks to a couple of months with a preference to the shorter time scale.

201
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

202
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Build projects around motivated individuals, give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.

203
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:33,000
The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

204
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Working software is the primary measure of progress.

205
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Agile processes promote sustainable development.

206
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:48,000
The sponsors, developers and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

207
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

208
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Simplicity. The art of maximizing the amount of work not done is essential.

209
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

210
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:16,000
At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective than tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

211
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Let us now quickly recap this lesson.

212
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,000
A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result.

213
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Project success depends on the ability and maturity of the organization, carrying out the project, communication and collaboration between stakeholders and understanding of project requirements.

214
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
The project lifecycle approach can be predictive, adaptive, agile or hybrid.

215
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The PVMO supports ongoing projects and can be supportive, directive or controlling.

216
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Organizational project management involves the strategic alignment of organizational objectives with projects, programs and portfolios.

217
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Organizational structures impact the relative authority of the project manager.

218
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
The agile manifesto outlines four foundational core values.

219
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:20,000
The PIM Bach Guide Senate Edition articulates 12 principles of project management and eight performance domains.

220
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Projects are tailored to their context to enable better outcomes.

221
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
TIGIC Alignment.

222
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:44,000
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to identify the three components of the PMI talent triangle to recognize their significance in project management.

223
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Define the key elements of strategic management in an organization and associate their role in project management.

224
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Differentiate between enterprise environmental factors and organizational process assets and recognize their influence on projects.

225
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Analyze the internal and external business environment to assess its impact on project management effectiveness.

226
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
In this topic, we are going to learn about strategic alignment to business.

227
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Certain skills are vital and strategically aligning projects to the business.

228
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:37,000
The PMI talent triangle reflects the skills required by today's project professionals and change makers as they navigate the changing landscape of project management.

229
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Let us look at those skills one by one.

230
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
The first skill is ways of working.

231
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It involves mastering diverse and creative approaches such as predictive, adaptive and design thinking for accomplishing tasks and aligns with the process domain of ECO.

232
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Next is power of skills.

233
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It comprises of critical interpersonal skills that are required to apply influence, inspire change and build relationships, and it is aligned to the people domain of ECO.

234
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Finally, it is the business acumen.

235
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It involves effective decision making and understanding of how projects align with the big picture of broader organizational strategy and global trends.

236
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
This aligns with the business environment domain of the ECO.

237
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:40,000
To strategically align projects to the business, project managers must have an overview of the organization's strategic plan and an understanding of the business plans.

238
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:48,000
They must also collaborate with business stakeholders, SMEs, and sponsors to develop an appropriate delivery strategy.

239
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Realize the benefits of a project.

240
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
In this topic, let us look into the strategic management elements.

241
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Strategic management elements include vision that represents where the business aspires to go.

242
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Mission that defines the pre-established objective or purpose, objectives or well-defined areas of pursuit, goals which are the milestones and allocated resources.

243
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Strategies to use the resources to accomplish the organization's purpose, programs or projects to translate the strategies into action and results.

244
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Standard operating procedures SOPs for carrying out routine activities and organizational structures or the arrangement of roles and responsibilities within the organization.

245
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
The illustration here depicts the strategic management framework.

246
00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:03,000
The vision, mission, objectives and goals are met by identifying specific strategies that can be implemented through managing the portfolio of programs and projects, as well as ongoing operations.

247
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:13,000
The organizational structure should also support the achievement of these objectives.

248
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Let us now look at the various organizational factors that influence projects.

249
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Projects are influenced by two main categories of factors.

250
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:32,000
The first one is the Enterprise Environmental Factors E-F. These can be either internal or external.

251
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Internal factors encompass aspects like organizational culture, facilities, employee capabilities and availability.

252
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:49,000
External factors include market conditions, legal restrictions, regulations, socio-cultural influences and more.

253
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
The second category of factors is the organizational process assets, OPA.

254
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:03,000
This category includes plans, policies, procedures and templates, as well as historical project information.

255
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Understanding the external business environment involves using frameworks or prompts to assess external factors that may introduce risks, uncertainties or opportunities.

256
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Ultimately influencing the value and desired outcomes of project.

257
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Some common frameworks that can be used are PESSL, EXAMINING Risks or Changes related to political, economic, sociocultural, technical, legal and environmental factors.

258
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,000
T-COP focusing on technical, environmental, commercial, operational and political aspects.

259
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:47,000
VUCA addressing volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity.

260
00:27:47,000 --> 00:28:02,000
In terms of the internal business environment, the project manager, sponsor and product owner should be aware of the organization's business plans, policies, process reorganization or any other implemented changes.

261
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,000
It is important to note that internal changes within the organization can also impact the project's scope.

262
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
For instance, a change in business priorities could affect one or more of the following.

263
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Reprioritizing the delivery of business value to the customer, creating a need for new deliverables, reworking on existing deliverables, eliminating certain deliverables.

264
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Let us now quickly recap this lesson. The PMI Talent Triangle reflects the skills needed for project professionals, which are ways of working, power skills and business acumen.

265
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Project managers need to have an overview of the organization's strategic plan and an understanding of the business plans.

266
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Strategic management elements in an organization include vision, mission, objectives, goals, shops and organizational structure.

267
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Factors influencing projects include enterprise environmental factors and organizational process assets.

268
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:16,000
A project manager must understand the internal and external business environment for effective project management.

269
00:29:50,000 --> 00:30:13,000
In this lesson, we are going to learn about project benefits and value.

270
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:22,000
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to define the concept of business value and recognize its importance in a business environment.

271
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Differentiate between tangible and intangible forms of business value and understand their significance in business activities.

272
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Identify key business documents related to a project and analyze their roles in project management.

273
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Evaluate various benefit measurement methods to determine their applicability in assessing business initiatives.

274
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Explain the concept of objectives and key results, OKR as a goal setting and performance measurement method and understand its utility in achieving business goals.

275
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Recognize the benefits of employing an incremental approach in project management and understand its contribution to business initiatives.

276
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Let's now start by understanding the business value and its types.

277
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Business value refers to the net quantifiable benefit identified from a business endeavor. It can be tangible or intangible.

278
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:32,000
The business case and benefits management plan outlines the benefits or value to the business.

279
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Project managers are responsible for balancing the urgency to deliver based on stakeholder expectations.

280
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:50,000
The project team must understand what is valued in the business and their quality expectations while exploring ways to deliver value sooner.

281
00:31:50,000 --> 00:32:00,000
As discussed, business value can be categorized into two types, tangible and intangible. Let's now discuss each type one by one.

282
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Tangible business value may include the following, financial gain, product improvements, new markets or customers, first mover advantage in the market, technological benefits, social benefits and compliance to regulatory requirements,

283
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:29,000
whereas intangible business value may include brand recognition, goodwill, patents and trademarks, copyrights and proprietary technology.

284
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:40,000
In this topic, we will explore various project related business documents.

285
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:48,000
There are two types of project business documents, the project business case and the project benefits management plan.

286
00:32:48,000 --> 00:33:05,000
A project business case is a documented economic feasibility study used to establish the validity of benefits of a selected component lacking sufficient definition and used as a basis for the authorization of further project management activities.

287
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:18,000
On the other hand, a project benefits management plan is the documented explanation defining the processes for creating, maximizing and sustaining the benefits provided by a project.

288
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:40,000
A business case may include but is not limited to documenting the following elements, the business need and analysis of the situation, available options such as doing nothing, doing the minimum work necessary, doing more than the minimum work necessary, a recommendation and an evaluation.

289
00:33:40,000 --> 00:34:06,000
The Benefits Management Plan describes the key elements of the benefits and may include but are not limited to the documentation of the following, target benefits, strategic alignment, timeframe, list of benefits owners, metrics, assumptions and risks.

290
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Let us now look into the various benefits measurement methods. Before preparing the business case, it's crucial to assess the business needs.

291
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:25,000
A business analyst conducts a business needs assessment to uncover the following information. What are the business goals and objectives?

292
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:46,000
What opportunities are available and what issues need to be addressed? Based on the information gathered, the business analyst will make recommendations on the following, the action to be taken or what needs to be done, constraints, assumptions, risks and dependencies, success measures and implementation approach.

293
00:34:46,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Before we dive into the methods for measuring benefits, let's get familiar with a few key terms. Benefit Cost Analysis. The primary goal here is to evaluate and select an alternative where the benefits outweigh the costs.

294
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Present Value PV. This represents the current discounted value of money expected in the future. It can be calculated by dividing FV by 1 plus R to the power in.

295
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Where? FV stands for the expected amount of money in the future. R is the rate of discounting and in represents the number of years.

296
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Moving on, there are two types of benefit measurement methods. The business based method includes payback period and opportunity cost.

297
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:46,000
While the financial based method includes net present value, NPV, internal rate of return, IRR and return on investment, ROI.

298
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:58,000
In the business based methods, payback period is the time it takes to recover the investment or reach the break even point. The shorter the payback period, the better.

299
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Opportunity Cost is the cost of the project that was not selected or is foregone in favor of the chosen one. Understanding the opportunity cost helps recognize the potential benefits that are being given up, enabling one to make well-informed decisions.

300
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:26,000
In the financial based methods, net present value or NPV represents the difference between the sum of cash outflows and the sum of cash inflows.

301
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:38,000
It's calculated as sum of present values minus the investment. NPV is a method commonly used for capital budgeting, the higher the NPV, the better the project.

302
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Internal rate of return or IRR is the rate of return at which NPV becomes zero. In other words, it's the point where the sum of cash outflows equals the cash inflows.

303
00:36:51,000 --> 00:37:04,000
A higher IRR indicates a better investment. Return on investment or ROI is a measure of returns over a specific period, typically expressed as a percentage.

304
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:19,000
It's calculated as net benefit divided by cost, where net benefit is derived as total benefits minus total costs.

305
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Let us now understand what objectives and key results are. Objectives and key results, or OKRs, represent a goal-setting approach for measuring an organization's performance and value.

306
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:41,000
In this method, a company's business strategy is broken down into clear objectives and key results.

307
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:53,000
OKRs, help define what the company intends to invest in over time. These objectives are further divided into business increments and additional objectives.

308
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:05,000
The key results and milestones are reviewed over a defined time frame. How does incremental value delivery work? The delivery of features and functions is broken down and delivered frequently.

309
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Partial delivery allows for feedback and course correction. Incremental delivery reveals any latent or missed requirements.

310
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:28,000
The execution can follow two methods, iteration-based and flow-based. In an iteration-based approach, each sprint is time-boxed equally. The team takes up priority features and delivers them first.

311
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Whereas in a flow-based approach, the time for each sprint is not the same. The team will pull work for their capacity to start work, rather than following an iteration-based schedule.

312
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Incremental delivery leads to quicker delivery of value.

313
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Let us now quickly recap this lesson. The net quantifiable benefit identified from a business endeavor is referred to as business value.

314
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Business value can be either tangible or intangible. Project business documents include a business case and a benefits management plan.

315
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Benefits measurement methods include net present value, NPV, internal rate of return, IRR and return on investment ROI.

316
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Objectives and key results, OKRs, is a method for setting goals and measuring performance. An incremental approach ensures better and early value delivery.

317
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Now that you have completed the lesson, let us look at the exam content outline, ECO, covered in this lesson.

318
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,000
We are going to learn about organizational culture and change management in this lesson.

319
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:02,000
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to recognize the significance of organizational culture as one of the critical success factors for a project.

320
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Assess how the culture of an organization influences its ability to embrace change.

321
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Analyze why organizations embrace change as a means to steer projects to success. Explain the use of the ADCAR model as a framework for organizational change.

322
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Identify the set of actions required to support organizational change.

323
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Recognize the necessity of having a change implementation plan in place.

324
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Provide how PMI's Brightline initiative provides a framework to implement enterprise level changes in organizations.

325
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Let's start with organizational culture and change.

326
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Organizational culture is one of the critical success factors for the project.

327
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
The culture of the organization influences its ability to embrace change.

328
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Risk attitudes and thresholds shape the culture of the organization.

329
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Organizational culture includes various elements such as leadership hierarchy and authority, shared vision, beliefs and expectations, diversity, equity and inclusion practices,

330
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:28,000
risk tolerance, regulations, policies and procedures, code of conduct, operating environments and motivation and reward systems.

331
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Let us now understand the importance of change management.

332
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Organizations embrace change as a strategy to balance investments, manage risk, become more flexible and ensure maximum return on investment.

333
00:41:44,000 --> 00:42:03,000
There are organizations that have project management offices or PMOs which are responsible for establishing and maintaining alignment between projects and the organization through process updates, capability enhancements and the development of new skills to support project management.

334
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Change management goes hand in hand with continuous improvement and knowledge transfer activities at the PMO level which is one of the three key areas where PMOs contribute to value delivery.

335
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Let's now discuss the change management framework.

336
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,000
The ADCAR model is used as a framework for organizational change through individual change.

337
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:41,000
It identifies five milestones that an individual must achieve in order to change successfully.

338
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:55,000
These are, awareness of the need for change, desire to support the change, knowledge of how to change, ability to demonstrate new skills and behaviors and reinforcement to make the change stick.

339
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,000
The project manager needs to effectively manage the impact of change on projects.

340
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Some of the actions to be taken by the project manager include assessing the organizational culture, evaluating the impact of organizational change on the project and determining the required actions.

341
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Recommending options for changes to the project and continually monitoring the external business environment for potential impacts on project scope and backlog.

342
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Let's now explore the actions required to support change. These include coaching and mentoring team members.

343
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Diting team members with an agile mindset to help them embrace change effectively.

344
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Maintaining a continuous and open flow of knowledge within the project, adopting a consultative approach, ensuring that the team is on board with the proposed changes and identifying and effectively managing potential conflicts.

345
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Please be cautious to avoid forcing changes and make an effort to avoid alienating resistance stakeholders.

346
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:11,000
For any change, a change implementation plan must be in place and must include the following steps.

347
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:18,000
1. Conducting an attitudinal survey with stakeholders to understand their views on the change.

348
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Sensitizing stakeholders about the change. Communicating transparently about the impact of the change and creating a change rollout plan that includes knowledge, training, and other activities as part of the change implementation.

349
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:41,000
PMI's Brightline initiative gives a framework for practitioners to implement enterprise level changes.

350
00:44:41,000 --> 00:45:10,000
The Brightline Transformation Compass has five key transformation components that include a North Star statement that communicates the vision and strategic objectives, customer insights and global megatrends, a flat cross-functional transformation operating system, internal volunteer champions instead of external consultants, and an inside-out employee transformation approach similar to the ADCAR framework.

351
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Let us now quickly recap this lesson.

352
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Organizational Culture is a critical success factor for a project. The culture of an organization influences its ability to embrace change, organizations embrace change to steer projects toward success.

353
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:42,000
The ADCAR model is used as a framework for organizational change through individual change. A set of actions is required to support change.

354
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,000
A change implementation plan must be in place for any change.

355
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:58,000
PMI's Brightline initiative provides a framework for practitioners to implement enterprise level changes.

356
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Now that you have completed the lesson, let us look at the exam content outline ECO covered in this lesson.

357
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:15,000
In this lesson, we are going to learn about project governance and guidelines and applying governance to projects.

358
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:25,000
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to define the concept of project governance and its role in achieving project management objectives.

359
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Describe the components of governance.

360
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Differentiate between predictive and adaptive project approaches to understand their influence on project progression.

361
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Evaluate the importance of reviews and project environments to recognize their impact on value improvement and decision making for project advancement.

362
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Let's learn what project governance is and its components.

363
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Project governance is the framework, functions and processes that guide project management activities in order to create a unique product, service or result that meets organizational, strategic and operational goals.

364
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Identifying a governance structure is crucial for a project. Each project is unique in terms of requirements, risks and stakeholders among others.

365
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Depending on the project complexities, the governance structure could vary.

366
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,000
The structure is aligned with the organizational strategy and risk tolerances.

367
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Let's look at the complements of a project governance framework.

368
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:48,000
As stated in the PIMBOC guide, a project governance framework can include project success and deliverable acceptance criteria.

369
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
The process to identify, escalate and resolve issues.

370
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:58,000
The relationship between the project team, organizational groups and external stakeholders.

371
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:07,000
The project organization chart with the project roles, communication processes and procedures, processes for project decision making.

372
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Guidelines for aligning project governance and organizational strategy.

373
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
The project lifecycle approach. The process for stage date or phase reviews.

374
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:23,000
The process for the review and approval of changes above the project manager's authority.

375
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And the process to align internal stakeholders with the project process requirements.

376
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Let's look at the guidelines for good project governance.

377
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:47,000
These guidelines are involve the organization's decision makers who are frequently at senior managers.

378
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Choose the most appropriate governance goals and try to keep them simple.

379
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Select a group of experienced individuals to be responsible for all governance activities.

380
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Practice governance for projects, programs and portfolios.

381
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Keep the governance process transparent to the project stakeholders.

382
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:16,000
And finally, remember that governance is an evolutionary process and take advantage of the lessons you have learned during this process.

383
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Let us now understand the escalation procedure.

384
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Escalation is the process of addressing issues or problems that fall beyond the authority of the project manager or the team.

385
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
When an issue falls within the defined threshold, the team will handle it.

386
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:40,000
If it exceeds the threshold, it gets escalated to the appropriate stakeholder for a decision and further action.

387
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:56,000
It's crucial to have well-defined escalation procedures and team members should be familiar with these processes to ensure timely responses.

388
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Let's explore how to apply governance to various types of projects.

389
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:19,000
According to PIMBOX 6th edition, at the beginning of each phase, it is a good practice to verify and validate the assumptions made before the project has begun, analyze the risks, and explain in detail the processes required to achieve the deliverables.

390
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:29,000
After the key deliverables of a particular phase are produced, a review at the end of the phase is necessary to ensure completeness and acceptance.

391
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:47,000
What is a phase gate? A phase gate, also known as a governance gate, tall gate or kill point, is a review at the end of a phase in which a decision is made to continue to the next phase as is, to continue with some modification or to end a project or program.

392
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Each review is used to check if each phase has fulfilled the exit criteria and is eligible to move to the next phase.

393
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,000
These criteria serve as thresholds for the continuation of the project.

394
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Software development projects can utilize a special type of phase gate called a quality gate, which is located before a phase that is strongly dependent upon the outcomes of a previous phase.

395
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:40,000
When it comes to adaptive projects, the process of applying governance includes the following steps, splitting work into releases, reviewing results at the end of iterations, gathering feedback and taking action to improve value in the next iteration, continuing until the customer's acceptance criteria, for example, definition of done or MVP are satisfied or the project ends.

396
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Let us now quickly recap this lesson. Project governance is a framework that provides oversight of processes and procedures, guiding project management activities to achieve objectives.

397
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Governance encompasses processes for a life cycle approach, phase reviews, success and deliverable acceptance criteria.

398
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Governance also includes identification, escalation and resolution of issues and approval of changes beyond the project manager's authority.

399
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:24,000
In predictive projects, a review at the end of a phase, known as the phase gate review, determines the transition to the next phase.

400
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:34,000
In adaptive projects, a review is conducted at the end of each iteration, and based on the feedback received, improvements are planned for the subsequent iteration.

401
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Now that you have completed the lesson, let us look at the exam content outline, ECO, covered in this lesson.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,160
In this lesson, we are going to explore the concept of compliance and its requirements,

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,160
categories, risks on non-compliance and best practices.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,640
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to manage compliance throughout the project

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,960
to ensure adherence to necessary standards and regulations.

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,280
By various compliance categories to understand different areas of regulatory requirements,

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:37,200
identify potential threats to compliance within the project's scope and context, analyze

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,560
the consequences of non-compliance and develop effective strategies to manage and mitigate

8
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:49,720
associated risks, implement best practices for compliance management to enhance project

9
00:00:49,720 --> 00:01:00,920
integrity and regulatory adherence.

10
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,880
Let us understand the concepts related to project compliance, like categories, requirements

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,640
and best practices.

12
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:16,240
The project manager has to identify and manage compliance requirements for the project.

13
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,320
Compliance is also an important area to be tracked and managed throughout the project.

14
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,600
Any non-compliance to the requirements might jeopardize the project's interest.

15
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,600
Some projects might have regulatory compliance as a mandatory requirement.

16
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:38,320
For example, projects in aviation, food, drugs and clinical trials might require approvals

17
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,080
or sanctions from government regulatory bodies or agencies.

18
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,680
Let's look at the classification of compliance categories.

19
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:55,320
Generally, types of compliance are categorized into environmental risk, workplace health and safety,

20
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,080
corrupt practices, social responsibility, quality and process risks.

21
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,480
These categories might vary depending on the industry and type of project.

22
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,000
Let's now understand how changes to the compliance requirements can be identified.

23
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:19,240
Compliance requirements could change with changes to any of the environmental factors associated with the project.

24
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:24,440
The potential changes include identification of new vulnerabilities,

25
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:31,840
changes in legal or regulatory requirements, errors in testing and validation to confirm compliance,

26
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,760
errors or bugs and deliverables, and lack of awareness of compliance requirements.

27
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:46,160
Non-compliance could lead to unnecessary legal problems besides delay in execution and escalation and cost.

28
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,200
Therefore, the project manager has to identify the compliance requirements pertaining to legal,

29
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,680
regulatory, environmental and other factors right at the beginning of planning the project.

30
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:06,880
In some projects, expert resources might have to be onboarded in the team for tracking and managing compliance requirements.

31
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,200
Project managers need to ensure that compliance requirements for the project are continually identified,

32
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,680
communicated and managed.

33
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,520
To manage compliance requirements, any changes to the requirements are identified and analyzed for their impact,

34
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,720
and the corresponding updates are made to the project plan.

35
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,160
Some of the best practices for compliance management include

36
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,040
documentation, updating compliance needs and risks in the risk register,

37
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,240
risk planning, prioritizing compliance in risk planning, compliance counsel,

38
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,840
establishing a compliance counsel for governance and oversight,

39
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:55,440
compliance audits, using compliance audits to ensure procedure adherence and compliance stewardship,

40
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:02,440
assigning the project manager the responsibility of steering and managing compliance.

41
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,920
Let us take a look at a project scenario.

42
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:19,280
Of late, it is observed that the leads and inquiries received from customers are not getting turned into opportunities.

43
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,880
It is also becoming difficult to track them to convert into orders.

44
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,720
For confirmed orders received, there is no single way of keeping a track of pending orders.

45
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:36,640
Each function in the organization tries to follow their own processes to maintain records of their function.

46
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:43,240
This was putting a lot of pressure on the business team as the response from the market was not encouraging.

47
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:49,800
Phillips is a project manager working for a reputed product company manufacturing electronic parts

48
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,960
for the automotive industry in your city.

49
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,200
The company has orders for the next five years and phases in the growing.

50
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:06,520
In a bid to put an end to this problem, the management decides to implement an enterprise resource planning or ERP system

51
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,400
so that there could be a single platform for all transactions across functions within the company

52
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,040
and offer a clear view of what is happening at various levels within the organization.

53
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,760
Management information system reports are expected to be current at any point in time.

54
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:32,200
What are some of the key things that you would advise Phillips with specific reference to compliance and governance structure for the project?

55
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:38,080
Phillips should begin by gathering the compliance requirements applicable to the project.

56
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:48,000
These requirements may encompass areas such as quality, technical, IT, legal, licenses for users, training and more.

57
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,440
Requirement gathering should be a comprehensive exercise involving teams from all functions.

58
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:02,360
Additionally, consider establishing a cross-functional compliance council to oversee and monitor compliance.

59
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:12,040
In an ERP implementation, change management plays a significant role as users must adapt to new work processes through the system.

60
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:18,320
Similarly, post-implementation users may require initial support and guidance.

61
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:32,960
Regarding the governance structure, since implementing an ERP is an organization-wide initiative involving various functions like finance, sales, HR, marketing, materials management, stores and inventory,

62
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,640
consider forming a project committee comprising all functional heads.

63
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:47,200
This committee can oversee implementation, manage changes in their respective functions, and assist in finalizing requirements and sign-offs.

64
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:59,520
The committee may also act as change-makers guiding their teams through necessary business process re-engineering to align with the ERP, as well as planning user training and support.

65
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:09,960
Phillips may also need to decide whether the project committee will have a subcommittee handling compliance matters, or if a separate compliance council will be formed.

66
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,280
This decision can be project-specific following organizational procedures.

67
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:26,960
In some organizations, a PMO or project management office could be established solely for the implementation, encompassing all the aforementioned responsibilities.

68
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,520
Let us now quickly recap this lesson.

69
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:44,520
Compliance requires continuous tracking and management throughout the project, encompassing the identification and categorization of compliance requirements.

70
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:55,520
This process also involves identifying and tracking potential threats to compliance, as well as analyzing and managing the consequences of non-compliance.

71
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,520
Non-compliance with requirements may jeopardize the project's interests.

72
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:09,520
Certain projects, such as those in aviation, food and drugs and clinical trials, have mandatory regulatory compliance requirements.

73
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:20,520
Compliance categories include environmental risk, workplace health and safety, corrupt practices, social responsibility, quality and process risks.

74
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:30,520
Compliance requirements may change in response to alterations in the environmental factors associated with the project.

75
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:41,520
Now that you have completed the lesson, let us look at the exam content outline ECO covered in this lesson.
