# PMP Exam Prep Website â€” Readerâ€™s Guide

## BLUF â€” Why this site exists
This website is a focused **PMP exam prep companion**. It organizes lesson notes, examples, and practice assets around the **PMP Examination Content Outline (ECO)** and cross-references the **PMBOK 6/7** perspectives. You can **read it straight through** like a short book or **jump by module** to the exact topic you need. The goal is simple: keep you oriented, reduce search friction, and help you retain what matters on exam day. 

---
## Is this the right resource for you?
If youâ€™re self-studying, following a course agenda, or converting your own transcripts into durable notes, youâ€™re in the right place. This site is **not** PMIâ€™s proprietary content and **not** a question dump; itâ€™s a structured knowledge base with **original summaries**, **cross-links to ECO tasks/enablers**, and **practice scaffolds** that nudge you toward situational judgment.

---
## Welcome aboard â€” jump in
Open the **Index (Table of Contents)** and pick your current section (100 Business Environment, 200 Process, 300 People).  
Short on time? Dip into the **Exam Prep (400)** micro-sets for a quick win.  
Have an hour? Take a full lesson: read the overview, scan the key topics, and try the activities.  

This site is designed for **roam-and-return** â€” you can follow a link for a deeper dive and then step right back to where you were.

## How to navigate the site

### Two study modes
- **Read it like a book:** Start at the top of the Index and work down lesson by lesson. This gives you a clean, linear path through the core domains.  
- **Study by module:** Jump directly to Business Environment (100), Process (200), or People (300) when you need targeted review or to match a class agenda.
### Cross-connecting links (your safety net)
Pages include **cross-links** to related ideas and **ECO anchors** so you can zoom in when a concept needs more depth â€” then **jump back** via breadcrumbs or the browserâ€™s back button. The intention is to make it easy to **branch out, learn, and return** without losing your place.
### Glossary and quick references
A site-wide **Glossary** (500-series) collects key terms and definitions, and the **PMBOK 6â†”7 Crosswalk** helps you translate between the classic process/knowledge-area view and the newer domain/principle view.

> Tip: When you see an ECO code like **3.2.1**, that means **Domain 3 â†’ Task 2 â†’ Enabler 1**. Lesson pages list the codes they support and link to those ECO anchors.

## Agenda â€” Cadence Source of Truth
The full **Agenda** mirrors the PMI Institute Course of instruction and follows a specific day by Excel schedule (Day 1 â†’ Day 20).  

The agenda is the **cadence controller** for this site, ensuring each dayâ€™s lesson(s) are prepared, cross-linked, and published on time.

## Inside a lesson (what to expect)
Each lesson follows a predictable rhythm so you can skim first and study second:
- **Overview** â€” A short setup explaining why the topic matters.  
- **Learning Objectives** â€” What youâ€™ll be able to do after the page.  
- **Key Topics** â€” The signposts for scanning.  
- **Activities** â€” Simple prompts (and occasional micro-quizzes) to build recall.  
- **Summary** â€” Ties the topic back to exam scenarios and the ECO.  
- **ECO Links** â€” Direct anchors to relevant tasks/enablers when you want the PMI lens.

## Study patterns that work here
- **Daily quick win (7â€“10 min):** Try a **10@10** formula set or the recall prompts at the end of one lesson.  
- **Weekly boss fight (30â€“60 min):** Do a domain-weighted practice set, then log mistakes and hop (via cross-links) to the pages that fix those gaps.  
- **Error log loop:** Keep a running note of your top repeats and link each entry back to its lesson â€” turn mistakes into pointers.
