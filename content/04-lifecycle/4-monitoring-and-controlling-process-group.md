# Monitoring & Controlling Process Group
![[mandc1.jpg|320x200]]
**What it is.** Monitoring & Controlling keeps a project honest. You compare what actually happened to what you planned (scope, schedule, cost, plus quality, resources, risk), spot variances early, and make deliberate adjustments so the work stays aligned with the objectives—never by accidental drift. This discipline runs continuously alongside every other group: Executing produces data; you measure it against the plan; when something’s off, you evaluate options, decide, and communicate clearly. 

**What this looks like in practice.**
- Track real performance against baselines and call out green/yellow/red health so everyone sees risks in time to act. 
- Use a simple, truthful status report to surface issues and ask for help or decisions.
- When change is proposed (or required), analyze the impact across time, cost, scope, quality, resources, and risk; then route a formal change for a decision and update the baseline if approved. 
- Keep stakeholders informed with concise, timely updates—the good, the bad, and the fix.

## Monitoring vs. Controlling (short takes)

Monitoring is the process of continuously measuring and analyzing project performance so that issues are surfaced early and corrective options remain open. It answers questions like: *Where are we compared to the plan? What trends are forming? What risks are emerging?* The foundation of monitoring comes from the [[project-management-plan]], which holds the baselines and subsidiary plans for scope, schedule, cost, quality, resources, communications, risks, procurements, and stakeholders. Alongside it, [[project-documents]]—such as assumption, issue, and change logs, requirements traceability, the risk register, lessons learned, and updated forecasts—provide the evidence for analysis. Real-time [[work-performance-data]] flows in from Executing, while [[agreements]], [[eefs]], and [[opas]] ensure that monitoring is conducted in the right contractual and organizational context.  

To process this information, monitoring uses a toolkit of [[data-analysis]] techniques, including variance and trend analysis, earned value management (EVM), forecasting methods like estimate at completion (EAC), and root-cause or reserve analysis. Results are then visualized through [[data-representation]] tools such as dashboards, burn charts, and control charts. Decisions are guided by [[decision-methods]] like expert judgment, multi-criteria analysis, and collaborative [[meetings]], while [[pmis-and-reporting-systems]] provide the infrastructure for sharing status updates. Monitoring also emphasizes [[risk-reassessment-and-audits]] as well as stakeholder and communication feedback loops, keeping the process iterative and responsive.  

The outputs of monitoring create decision-ready artifacts. [[work-performance-reports]] consolidate the findings into tailored updates for stakeholders. [[change-requests]] may emerge when corrective, preventive, or defect repair actions are needed. Updates ripple into the [[project-management-plan]] itself (subsidiary plans and baselines), [[project-documents]] such as logs and lessons learned, and [[opas]] that capture organizational knowledge. Stakeholder communications are updated as well, ensuring that information is timely and transparent.  

In short, monitoring acts as the project’s diagnostic system—detecting performance signals, comparing them to thresholds, and highlighting where intervention may be required. It sets the stage for controlling, where the actual treatment—decisions, approvals, and implementation—takes place.


**Monitoring.** Ongoing measurement and analysis. You observe results, compare them to baselines and thresholds, and surface variances early so options remain open. Monitoring answers: *Where are we vs. plan? What’s trending? What risks are emerging?* 

### Monitoring — ITTOs (quick reference)

**Inputs**
- **Project Management Plan** (scope/schedule/cost baselines; quality, resource, communications, risk, procurement, stakeholder plans)  
- **Project Documents** (assumption/issue/change logs; requirements & traceability; risk register; lessons learned; **schedule & cost forecasts**)  
- **Work Performance Data** (actuals from Executing)  
- **Agreements**, **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)**, **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)**

**Tools & Techniques**
- **Data Analysis:** variance/trend analysis, **EVM**, forecasting (e.g., EAC), root-cause analysis, reserve analysis  
- **Data Representation:** dashboards, burn/control charts  
- **Decision Methods:** expert judgment, multi-criteria analysis; **meetings**  
- **PMIS/Reporting Systems**; **risk reassessment & audits**; stakeholder/communications feedback loops

**Outputs**
- **Work Performance Reports** (tailored, decision-ready)  
- **Change Requests** (corrective/preventive/defect repair)  
- **Updates:** project management plan (subsidiary plans & baselines), project documents (risk/issue/change logs, lessons learned), OPAs; stakeholder communications

*Use this set as the default for “monitoring” activities; then tailor per process (e.g., Monitor Risks emphasizes risk audits/reassessment; Monitor Communications emphasizes information needs and feedback).* :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}


**Controlling.** Decision and adjustment. You choose corrective or preventive actions, route changes for approval, update baselines when needed, and communicate decisions. Controlling answers: *What will we change, who approves it, and how do we keep alignment?* 

### Controlling — ITTOs (quick reference)
The Monitoring and Controlling Process Group relies on a set of critical inputs that anchor all evaluation and decision-making. The [[project-management-plan]] is central, containing baselines for scope, schedule, and cost, along with subsidiary plans for quality, resources, risks, communications, procurements, and stakeholders. Alongside it, [[project-documents]] such as issue and change logs, requirements traceability matrices, quality reports, risk registers, lessons learned, and procurement records provide the detailed evidence needed to measure progress and identify issues. [[work-performance-information]]—analyzed data flowing from Executing and Monitoring—supplies the actuals against which performance is assessed. Supporting context comes from [[agreements]] with vendors, plus enterprise environmental factors ([[eefs]]) and organizational process assets ([[opas]]), ensuring that project decisions align with both contractual obligations and organizational norms.  

To interpret these inputs, the group employs a versatile toolkit of tools and techniques. [[data-analysis]] methods such as variance and trend analysis, root-cause investigations, what-if scenarios, earned value management (EVM), and forecasting are used to understand performance and anticipate outcomes. [[decision-methods-and-governance]]—including expert judgment, multi-criteria decision analysis, and formal change control boards—help determine the best course of action when variances or change requests arise. [[measurement-and-review]] activities like inspections, audits, control charts, burn charts, checklists, and sampling provide objective verification of deliverables and processes. Finally, [[systems-and-collaboration]] tools such as project management information systems (PMIS), dashboards, workshops, and negotiation or claims administration (especially when suppliers are involved) enable transparent oversight and effective coordination across stakeholders.  

Together, these inputs and tools form the foundation of Monitoring and Controlling, creating the structure for variance detection, analysis, and corrective decision-making that keeps projects aligned with their objectives.


In the Monitoring and Controlling Process Group, outputs represent the tangible results of tracking, evaluating, and guiding project performance. The most visible are [[change-requests]], which may include corrective actions to realign work, preventive actions to avoid future problems, or defect repairs to fix identified issues. These requests are routed through [[perform-integrated-change-control]] for evaluation. When approved, they generate [[approved-changes]] that update project baselines and plans, ensuring the team always works from the latest roadmap.  

Another key output is [[work-performance-reports]], which consolidate measurements from control processes into actionable insights. These reports highlight trends, variances, and forecasts that help stakeholders make informed decisions. In addition, various [[updates]] are produced across project documents—such as risk logs, issue logs, change logs, requirements documents, lessons learned registers, procurement records, and organizational process assets (OPAs). These updates keep the project’s knowledge base current and usable for both immediate action and future reference.  

Finally, the group produces [[deliverable-status-artifacts]], such as verified deliverables from quality control and accepted deliverables from scope validation. These artifacts serve as checkpoints, confirming that outputs meet requirements and are formally approved before being transitioned toward closing.  

Together, these outputs form the default toolkit for controlling processes, adaptable to scope, schedule, cost, quality, resources, procurements, communications, risks, and stakeholders. When combined with the inputs and outputs of monitoring, they complete the loop from variance detection to decision-making and approved change implementation. Monitoring serves as diagnosis—detecting, analyzing, and forecasting issues—while controlling functions as treatment, where actions are decided, approved, and implemented. Monitoring can occur without change, but controlling begins only when intervention is required.

**Shared ITTOs — how they work across both**

The **Project Management Plan** is the anchor input in both monitoring and controlling: it supplies the **baselines** and subsidiary plans you measure against, and it’s the artifact you update when approved changes occur. **Project documents** (issues, risks, requirements, logs) flow both ways—fueling analysis during monitoring and capturing decisions during controlling. **Work performance data/information** evolves into **work performance reports** that trigger **change requests**; once decisions are made, the plan, baselines, and documents are **updated**, and the next monitoring cycle uses those updates as the new truth. That loop is the engine that keeps the project aligned. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

In the Monitoring and Controlling Process Group, the various processes function together like a system of checks, balances, and adjustments that keep a project on course. At the center is [[monitor-and-control-project-work]], which involves comparing actual progress against the project management plan, identifying variances, and taking corrective action when needed. Any proposed adjustments feed into [[perform-integrated-change-control]], where change requests are evaluated in terms of their impact on scope, schedule, cost, quality, resources, and risk before approval or rejection.  

Scope is managed through both [[validate-scope]] and [[control-scope]]. Validation ensures that deliverables meet the requirements and receive formal acceptance, while Control keeps the scope baseline intact by monitoring changes and preventing scope creep. These processes work closely with [[control-schedule]] and [[control-costs]], which track timelines and expenditures, making sure the project is delivered on time and within budget.  

Quality and resources are also monitored continuously. [[control-quality]] ensures that outputs meet agreed standards, while [[control-resources]] verifies that people, equipment, and materials are being used effectively. Communication and risks are equally vital—[[monitor-communications]] checks that information is flowing to the right stakeholders, and [[monitor-risks]] evaluates whether existing risk responses remain effective or need adjustment.  

Beyond the internal project team, external elements must be managed as well. [[control-procurements]] ensures vendors and contracts deliver according to terms, while [[monitor-stakeholder-engagement]] gauges how stakeholders perceive and support the project, adjusting strategies to sustain commitment.  

Together, these processes form a feedback loop: data is gathered, compared to baselines, analyzed for variances, and used to make informed decisions. Monitoring provides visibility into performance, while controlling applies corrective actions to keep the project aligned with its objectives. This constant cycle ensures that a project is not just completed, but completed successfully.

## How variance becomes action

Variance management in the Monitoring and Controlling Process Group follows a clear cycle that turns detection into action. It begins with [[detect-and-diagnose]], where project results are compared to baselines and thresholds to identify deviations. This step often includes root-cause analysis to determine why the variance occurred and whether it signals a deeper issue.  

Once the cause is understood, the next step is [[choose-a-response]]. Here the project manager and team evaluate options: implement a corrective action to bring performance back in line, apply a preventive action to avoid future problems, or accept the variance with a documented rationale.  

If the response requires altering a baseline, the process moves into [[decide-the-change]]. A formal change request is submitted, evaluated for its impact on scope, schedule, cost, quality, resources, risks, and stakeholder expectations, then either approved or rejected through [[perform-integrated-change-control]]. Approved changes result in updates to the plan and baselines, ensuring the project remains guided by accurate references.  

Finally, the cycle closes with [[communicate]]. Status, decisions, and next steps must be shared with the right stakeholders at the right time. Transparent communication ensures alignment across the team, sustains stakeholder trust, and prevents misunderstandings as the project adapts.  

Together, these steps—diagnosis, response selection, decision-making, and communication—form the heartbeat of variance management, transforming raw deviations into controlled, purposeful project adjustments.

### Quick example

A deliverable misses a requirement. You flag it yellow, note the cause (missing content, not scope change), fix the gap (corrective action), and confirm the page now meets the acceptance criteria. If meeting the requirement would blow the schedule or budget, you’d instead raise a change for a decision—then update the baseline if approved and tell stakeholders exactly what changed and why. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## Key Processes in the Monitoring & Controlling Group
The Monitoring and Controlling Process Group is built around a set of key processes that ensure projects remain aligned with their objectives. At the center is [[monitor-and-control-project-work]], which involves tracking, reviewing, and reporting overall performance against the baselines. This creates the visibility needed to understand where the project stands at any given moment. When variances arise, they feed into [[perform-integrated-change-control]], where change requests are evaluated, approved, or rejected, and baselines are updated as necessary to reflect informed decisions.  

Scope management is addressed through [[validate-scope]] and [[control-scope]]. Validation confirms that deliverables meet stakeholder requirements and gain formal acceptance, while control prevents scope creep by keeping the work tightly aligned with the agreed scope baseline. These efforts are complemented by [[control-schedule]] and [[control-costs]], which use tools like earned value management (EVM) and trend analysis to manage variances and forecast outcomes.  

Risk management plays a continuous role, with [[monitor-risks]] ensuring that triggers and assumptions are tracked, while [[implement-risk-responses]] executes predefined strategies and recalibrates plans when necessary. Alongside risks, other areas must also be observed closely. [[monitor-communications]], [[control-quality]], [[control-resources]], and [[monitor-stakeholder-engagement]] confirm that the project’s communication, quality, resource, and engagement plans are being followed and remain effective.  

Taken together, these processes form the backbone of control. Importantly, control does not mean simply saying “no” to change—it means making [[informed-decisions]] that balance constraints and keep the project focused on its objectives.

## Variance, Change, and Communication
Variance, change, and communication form a continuous cycle in the [[monitoring-and-controlling-process-group]]. When a variance is detected, the team begins with root-cause analysis to understand why it occurred. From there, options are evaluated: take a corrective action to bring the project back in line, apply a preventive action to reduce future risk, or accept the variance with a documented rationale. If the response requires altering a baseline, [[perform-integrated-change-control]] ensures that the change is formally reviewed, approved, and incorporated into updated plans and baselines. Throughout this process, [[communicate]] remains essential—status, decisions, and next steps must be shared clearly and on time with the right stakeholders. This discipline prevents silent scope creep, sustains trust, and ensures that variances are anticipated when proper planning and contingency strategies are in place.  

### Example in Practice  

In CMPA 3302, Monitoring and Controlling is like checking weekly work against the rubric to confirm progress toward full marks. After Executing produces drafts—such as new category pages or interlinks—each deliverable is compared against the assignment rubric and module requirements. If something is missing, such as a page without three heading levels, an absent image, or a broken wikilink, that gap is treated as a variance.  

Corrective actions are then applied: revising structure, adding missing elements, or refining content until it matches expectations. Much like [[integrated-change-control]], each adjustment is intentional and logged, preventing scope creep while maintaining alignment with the baseline requirements. Every GitHub commit becomes part of the [[monitoring-and-controlling]] process, recording changes and providing traceability. By the time the assignment is submitted, deliverables are validated, the site functions as expected, and the evidence for a 100% rubric score is clearly documented.
