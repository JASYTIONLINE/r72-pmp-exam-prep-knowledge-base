# Monitoring & Controlling Process Group

The **Monitoring & Controlling Process Group** compares actual performance to the **baselines** established in Planning (scope, schedule, and cost) to detect variances early and steer the project back on track. It ensures that the right work is being done, to the right quality, at the right time and cost. This group also evaluates change requests, approves or rejects them through the appropriate authority, and updates plans and baselines **deliberately**—not accidentally.

Monitoring & Controlling is continuous and cross-cutting: it interacts with **every other process group**. Data from Executing is measured against the plan; when impacts are identified, the team uses the **integrated change control** process to evaluate options, decide, and communicate outcomes. Proactive risk monitoring and response keep threats in check and help capture opportunities.

## Key Processes in the Monitoring & Controlling Group

1. **Monitor and Control Project Work** — Track, review, and report performance.  
2. **Perform Integrated Change Control** — Evaluate, approve, or reject change requests and update baselines when needed.  
3. **Validate Scope / Control Scope** — Confirm deliverables meet requirements and prevent scope creep.  
4. **Control Schedule / Control Costs** — Manage variances and forecast outcomes (EVM, trend analysis).  
5. **Monitor Risks / Implement Risk Responses** — Watch triggers, execute responses, and recalibrate as needed.  
6. **Monitor Communications, Quality, Resources, and Stakeholder Engagement** — Ensure plans are followed and effective.  

> Control is not about saying “no”—it’s about making **informed decisions** that keep the project aligned with objectives.

## Variance, Change, and Communication

When variance is detected, the team analyzes root causes and considers options: corrective action, preventive action, or accepting the variance with rationale. Approved changes are incorporated through **formal updates** to the plan and baselines; status and decisions are communicated to the right stakeholders with clarity and timeliness. This discipline prevents silent scope creep and preserves trust. If proper planning took place, most variance will be anticipated and a contingency plan in place to account for it and course correct with minimal disruption to the project.

### Example in Practice

In CMPA 3302, Monitoring & Controlling is me checking my weekly work against the rubric to confirm I’m on track for full marks. After Executing produces drafts—such as new category pages or interlinks—I compare each deliverable against the assignment’s rubric and the requirements laid out in the module overview. If something is missing (e.g., a page without three heading levels, an absent image, or a broken wikilink), that’s a variance.

I then apply corrective actions: fixing the structure, adding missing elements, or revising the content until it matches expectations. Just like integrated change control, these adjustments are deliberate—each revision updates my work breakdown flow without introducing accidental scope creep. Each commit on GitHub is part of the Monitoring & Controlling process which ensures that changes are logged, and before I submit, every requirement is validated, the site functions correctly, and I have clear evidence for a 100% rubric score.
