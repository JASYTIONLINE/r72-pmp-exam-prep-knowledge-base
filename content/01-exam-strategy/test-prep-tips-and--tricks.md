# Test Preparation Essentials

**What this page is about:**  
This page is your quick start to PMP test readiness. It explains how to arrive at the exam calm, clear, and primed to choose the best answer. Use it as a hub: first to set healthy, repeatable habits for test day, then to apply principle-driven tactics when reading questions and eliminating distractors. The goal is confidence under time pressure—not cramming.

## What’s included on this page

**Study Habits for Exam Day**  
Sleep **7–9 hours**, eat balanced (complex **carbs + protein**), hydrate, time caffeine, arrive early, and take a 2–3 minute breathing/scan warm-up.

**Answer-Selection Tactics**  
Read the **entire** stem; note your role and context. Watch qualifiers (**always/never**, **first/best/next**). Favor options that engage stakeholders, prevent issues, and follow governance. Use first impression only if it aligns with PM principles. Eliminate extremes or answers that add facts. Distinguish **first** vs **best** action. Mark-and-move to protect pacing.

> Placeholder: future updates will add a test-day checklist, pacing plan, common distractor patterns, and practice stems.
