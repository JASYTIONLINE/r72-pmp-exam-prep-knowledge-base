# JASYTI's PMI Compliant PMP Examination Prep Course (Knowledge Base - HOME)
CMPA 3302

## What am I looking at?  
This site is a Project Management Professional knowledge base built to give you clarity, structure, and tools you can actually use. It’s mapped to PMI’s Examination Content Outline (ECO) and cross-referenced with PMBOK guidance. Think of it as your table of contents and your launchpad.

## Welcome  
Maybe you found this site through a friend, a late-night scroll, or because the universe finally got tired of watching you wing it. Either way—you’re here, and you belong here. If you’re like me, you’ve been managing people, timelines, and deliverables for years without the title, the pay, or the support.

## What is a Project Management Professional?**  
You already are one, even if nobody’s ever called you that. Students, homemakers, managers, shift leaders—we all juggle projects every day. A PMP is simply someone who turns those unofficial skills into recognized, rewarded expertise.

### It’s your call!
The choice is simple: keep grinding without recognition, or take control of your skills, your time, and your career. This site gives you a system to do it—whether you follow it step by step or use it as your secret weapon alongside a course.

### Why is this here? 
I built this because I needed it. Studying project management changed how I work and how I live. I stopped feeling crushed by the grind and started leading with purpose, even outside the office.

### So, what are you going to do?  
This site is your launchpad, your reference hub, and your quiet advantage. The only question left is: _Are you ready to stop winging it and step into the role you’ve been living all along?_ If so—welcome aboard.

- Familiarity with basic project management concepts

## Purpose
