# Risk Response Strategies

Risk response is the set of actions a project team plans and executes to address identified risks. For **threats**, common strategies include **avoidance** (eliminating the risk altogether), **mitigation** (reducing likelihood or impact), **transfer** (shifting ownership, such as through insurance), and **acceptance** (acknowledging without active action, sometimes with contingency reserves). For **opportunities**, strategies include **exploitation** (ensuring the opportunity is realized), **enhancement** (increasing likelihood or benefit), **sharing** (partnering to capture value), and **acceptance** (taking advantage if it occurs).  

PMBOK 6 presents these strategies as outputs of the Plan Risk Responses process, feeding into project documents and updates. PMBOK 7 reframes them in terms of tailoring and value delivery, emphasizing proactive decision-making.  

This placeholder keeps the page functional and sets the stage for future content. Expanded versions will include practical examples, decision trees, and exam-focused mnemonics for remembering risk response types.
