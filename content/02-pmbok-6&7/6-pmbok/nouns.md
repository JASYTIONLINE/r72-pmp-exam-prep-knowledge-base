# Nouns in Project Management

In PMBOK study and practice, nouns matter because they represent the core “things” of project management: documents, deliverables, roles, and artifacts. Every process is built on nouns that define what is being created, tracked, or handed off. For example, the **risk register**, **project charter**, and **work breakdown structure** are all nouns—concrete items that can be referenced and examined.  

Recognizing nouns is especially useful for PMP exam preparation. Many questions test understanding of which artifact (noun) belongs to which process or knowledge area. By focusing on the nouns, students can often eliminate distractors and identify the correct answer more quickly.  

This placeholder confirms that the page is functioning. The completed version will provide lists of common PMBOK nouns, strategies for memorization, and examples showing how they connect across ITTOs, baselines, and artifacts in both PMBOK 6 and 7 frameworks.
