# Project Artifacts

Artifacts are the tangible by-products of project management processes. They include documents, plans, registers, reports, and deliverables that provide evidence of work performed and decisions made. PMBOK 6 refers to these as outputs within the ITTO framework, such as a scope statement, risk register, or project schedule. PMBOK 7 expands the concept by grouping artifacts into categories like plans, project documents, and deliverables, recognizing them as essential for knowledge sharing and value delivery.  

Artifacts serve multiple purposes: guiding execution, monitoring progress, enabling communication, and ensuring accountability. For example, a stakeholder register records who is impacted by the project, while a lessons learned register captures insights for future efforts.  

This placeholder ensures readers do not hit a blank page. A fuller version will map out key artifacts across PMBOK 6 and 7, explain their roles, and provide tips for tracking them efficiently in a digital knowledge base.>
