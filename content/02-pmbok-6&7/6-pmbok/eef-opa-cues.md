# Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEF)

Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs) are the external and internal conditions that influence, constrain, or enable a project. Unlike organizational process assets, which are internal resources under management’s control, EEFs are often outside the direct influence of the project team. They can include regulatory requirements, industry standards, organizational culture, political climate, market conditions, infrastructure, or human resource availability.  

Because they shape how processes are applied, EEFs must be recognized and accounted for in planning and execution. For example, strict compliance rules may require additional documentation, or global supply chain challenges may affect schedule feasibility.  

This placeholder page ensures that readers see functioning content rather than a blank node. In its completed form, this page will expand on categories of EEFs, provide PMBOK 6 vs. 7 treatment, and include examples that show how EEFs impact process tailoring, decision-making, and overall project outcomes.
