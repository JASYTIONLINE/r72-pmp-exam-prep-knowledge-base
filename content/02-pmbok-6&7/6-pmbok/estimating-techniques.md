# Estimating in Project Management

Estimating is the process of predicting the resources, effort, time, and costs required to complete project work. Accurate estimates provide the foundation for realistic schedules and budgets, and they serve as critical inputs to baselines. PMBOK guidance highlights several approaches: **analogous estimating** (using historical data), **parametric estimating** (applying statistical models), **three-point estimating** (optimistic, most likely, pessimistic), and **bottom-up estimating** (summing detailed work package estimates).  

While PMBOK 6 emphasizes estimating as part of planning processes tied to cost and schedule management, PMBOK 7 frames it within tailoring and value delivery, stressing adaptability and context.  

This placeholder ensures the page is active while signaling future expansion. The completed version will provide detailed examples of each method, discuss common pitfalls (such as padding or bias), and show how estimates flow into performance measurement, forecasting, and exam scenarios.
