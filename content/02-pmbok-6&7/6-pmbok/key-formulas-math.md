# Key Formulas in Project Management

Key formulas provide the quantitative backbone for project management, allowing performance to be measured and analyzed objectively. Common exam-tested calculations include **Earned Value Management (EVM)** formulas such as Cost Variance (CV = EV – AC), Schedule Variance (SV = EV – PV), Cost Performance Index (CPI = EV ÷ AC), and Schedule Performance Index (SPI = EV ÷ PV). Other essential equations include Estimate at Completion (EAC), Estimate to Complete (ETC), and Variance at Completion (VAC).  

Outside of EVM, the PMP exam also expects familiarity with formulas for expected monetary value (EMV), communication channels \[n(n – 1) ÷ 2], and three-point estimating \[(O + 4M + P) ÷ 6]. These calculations ensure project managers can forecast outcomes, evaluate trade-offs, and make evidence-based decisions.  

This placeholder confirms the page works and will later expand with worked examples, step-by-step breakdowns, and PMBOK 6 vs. PMBOK 7 emphasis on where formulas remain relevant.
