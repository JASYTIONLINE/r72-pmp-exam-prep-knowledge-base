# Process Groups → Knowledge Areas (Matrix View)

The Process Group–Knowledge Area matrix is a foundational tool in project management. It cross-references the five **process groups** (Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring & Controlling, Closing) with the ten **knowledge areas** (such as Scope, Schedule, Cost, Quality, Risk, and others) defined in the PMBOK framework. By mapping processes in this grid, students and practitioners can see how each process group interacts with every knowledge area, making the abstract structure of project management tangible. The matrix helps highlight overlaps, gaps, and dependencies, and it becomes a study map when preparing for the PMP exam. Although this page is currently a placeholder, its purpose is to reassure readers that the site is functioning correctly and that deeper explanations of each matrix intersection will follow. The final content will include detailed process listings, cross-links, and examples for each PG–KA connection, ensuring clarity across both PMBOK 6 and 7 perspectives.
