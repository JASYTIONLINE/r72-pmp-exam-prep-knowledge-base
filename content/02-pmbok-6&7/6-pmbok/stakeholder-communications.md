# Stakeholder Management

Stakeholder management is the process of identifying all individuals, groups, or organizations affected by a project and actively engaging them to ensure expectations are aligned. In PMBOK 6, this knowledge area emphasizes identifying stakeholders, planning engagement, managing expectations, and monitoring interactions throughout the life cycle. PMBOK 7 broadens the focus, framing stakeholder engagement as a principle that influences value delivery and continuous collaboration.  

Stakeholders range from project sponsors and customers to team members, regulators, and community groups. Effective management involves balancing competing interests, ensuring clear communication, and building trust. Tools like stakeholder registers, power/interest grids, and engagement assessments help visualize priorities and strategies.  

This placeholder confirms the link is active. Later versions will expand on techniques for analysis, provide case examples of engagement strategies, and explain how stakeholder management is tested on the PMP exam.
