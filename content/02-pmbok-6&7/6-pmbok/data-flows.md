# Data Flows

Data flows describe how information moves between processes in a project management framework. Every process consumes **inputs** (such as plans, documents, or environmental factors) and produces **outputs** (new plans, deliverables, updates, or change requests). These outputs often become inputs to later processes, creating a network of dependencies that define the “plumbing” of project management.  

Understanding data flows helps clarify how work is sequenced and why no process stands alone. For example, the risk register created in Planning becomes an input to Monitoring & Controlling, while deliverables from Executing flow into Quality Control for verification.  

This placeholder page ensures readers do not encounter an empty link. Future versions will expand the diagrams and explanations, showing how artifacts pass through the project life cycle. Visuals, cross-links to knowledge areas, and examples from both PMBOK 6 and PMBOK 7 perspectives will be added here for deeper study.
