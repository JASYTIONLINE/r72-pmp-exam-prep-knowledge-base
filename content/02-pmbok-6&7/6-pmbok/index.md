## PMBOK 6 Explained – Home

## How to use this section
PMBOK 6 is fact-dense by design. Treat this area as your **memorization hub** for processes and ITTO patterns. The *why* and *how* behind these lists are developed elsewhere: apply the concepts in [[05-theory-application/index|Theory Application]], watch them play out in [[06-case-studies/index|Case Studies]], see where they land across the [[04-lifecycle/index|Project Management Lifecycle]], and turn recall into points with [[00-gov-pmp/index|Test Prep & Tactics]]. Learn the facts here—use the other sections to understand, practice, and perform.
