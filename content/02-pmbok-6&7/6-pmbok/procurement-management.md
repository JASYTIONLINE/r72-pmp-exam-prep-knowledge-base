# Project Procurement Management

Procurement management covers the processes required to purchase or acquire products, services, or results needed from outside the project team. It involves planning procurements, conducting vendor selection, managing contracts, and closing procurements. In PMBOK 6, this is a full knowledge area with inputs, tools, and outputs linked to each process. In PMBOK 7, procurement is framed within principles of tailoring, risk sharing, and value delivery in external relationships.  

Procurement decisions influence cost, schedule, and quality performance. For example, a fixed-price contract transfers cost risk to the seller, while a cost-reimbursable contract places more risk on the buyer but allows for flexibility in scope. Strong procurement management also ensures compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.  

This placeholder exists to confirm the link is working. Future expansion will include contract types, vendor evaluation criteria, and case studies on effective procurement strategies.
