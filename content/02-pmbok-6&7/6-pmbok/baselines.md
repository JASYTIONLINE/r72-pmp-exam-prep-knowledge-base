# Project Baselines

Baselines are the fixed reference points that define the approved scope, schedule, and cost for a project. They serve as the benchmark against which performance is measured throughout execution and monitoring. The three most common are the **scope baseline** (work breakdown structure and scope statement), the **schedule baseline** (approved project timeline), and the **cost baseline** (authorized budget over time). Together, they form the **performance measurement baseline**, a critical tool for project control.  

When actual results deviate from these baselines, project managers can identify variances, analyze causes, and initiate corrective or preventive actions. Baselines also enable forecasting by showing how current trends may affect final outcomes.  

This placeholder exists to provide structure until full content is added. Future expansion will include detailed PMBOK references, visuals showing baseline integration, and examples of how baselines guide decisions and change management across both PMBOK 6 and PMBOK 7.
