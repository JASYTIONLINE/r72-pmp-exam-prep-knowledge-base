# Quality Tools

Quality tools are techniques that help project teams plan, manage, and improve the quality of processes and deliverables. PMBOK 6 highlights the classic **Seven Basic Quality Tools**: cause-and-effect diagram (Ishikawa/fishbone), check sheet, control chart, histogram, Pareto chart, scatter diagram, and flowchart. These tools allow teams to identify root causes, visualize variation, track defects, and prioritize improvements.  

In practice, quality tools provide evidence for decision-making. For example, a Pareto chart helps focus efforts on the “vital few” causes of defects, while control charts show whether a process is stable or trending out of bounds. PMBOK 7, with its value-driven approach, frames quality tools within a broader culture of continuous improvement and adaptability.  

This placeholder confirms the page is live and functional. The completed version will include worked examples, visuals for each tool, and guidance for exam preparation and real-world application.
