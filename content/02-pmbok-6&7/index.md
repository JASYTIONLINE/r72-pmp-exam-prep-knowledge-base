## PMBOK 6 & 7 – Compare and Contrast

PMBOK 6 and PMBOK 7 take different paths to the same goal: competent, value-focused project delivery. 

PMBOK 6 is process-centric and ITTO-driven—it explains **how** work moves through process groups and which inputs, tools, techniques, and outputs matter. 

PMBOK 7 reframes the guide around principles, performance domains, and value—clarifying **why** work is done and **what** outcomes should be achieved. This section puts the two lenses side-by-side so you can see where they align, where they diverge, and how to use both in situational reasoning. 

Here is where is where we study how to read a scenario, anchor on the relevant principle or domain, and then choose the fitting process/ITTO mechanics to deliver the intended outcome. The objective isn’t to pick a “winner” between editions; it’s to integrate both perspectives so exam responses and real-world decisions reflect PMI’s expectations and sound professional judgment.

PMBOK 6 & 7 Compare and Contrast connects to [[06-case-studies/index|Case Studies (6 vs. 7 in Action)]] since real projects reveal when a principle-led choice and a process-led choice converge—and which one becomes the “most right” answer under PMI’s lens.
