# Tailoring in PMBOK 7

In PMBOK 7, **tailoring is elevated to a guiding principle**. It is no longer a side note about adjusting processes but a foundational expectation: project managers must adapt methods, models, and artifacts to their project‚Äôs context. The principle stresses that every project is unique, shaped by stakeholders, risk levels, delivery approaches, and organizational environment.  

This is a significant shift from **PMBOK 6**, where tailoring was acknowledged mainly as a reminder to ‚Äúadjust the 49 processes when needed.‚Äù In PMBOK 7, tailoring drives how principles, performance domains, and value delivery are interpreted and applied.  

Tailoring ensures that teams avoid a ‚Äúchecklist mentality‚Äù and instead build fit-for-purpose approaches that maximize value.  

üëâ For comparison, see [[05-pmbok/6-pmbok/tailoring/index|Tailoring in PMBOK 6]], which explains tailoring as process adjustment within the ITTO-based framework.
