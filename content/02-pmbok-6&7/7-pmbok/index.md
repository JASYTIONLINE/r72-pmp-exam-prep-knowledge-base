## How to use this section
PMBOK 7 focuses on **principles**, **performance domains**, and **value delivery**. Treat this area as your **memorization hub** for concise cues and definitions. The *why* and *how* get developed elsewhere: apply in [[05-theory-application/index|Theory Application]], pressure-test with [[06-case-studies/index|Case Studies]], map across the [[04-lifecycle/index|Project Management Lifecycle]], and convert recall into points with [[00-gov-pmp/index|Test Prep & Tactics]]. Memorize essentials here—use the other sections to understand, practice, and perform.

## What this section covers (Quick Links)

- [[05-pmbok/7-pmbok/performance-domains/index|Performance domains (definitions & memory cues)]] — What each domain covers and the exam-relevant signals it triggers.
- [[05-pmbok/7-pmbok/value-delivery-system/index|Value delivery system & outcomes]] — How value flows and how outcomes are judged for fitness-for-use.
- [[05-pmbok/7-pmbok/tailoring/index|Tailoring in PMBOK 7 (prompts & patterns)]] — Tailoring prompts framed in principle/domain terms for fast selection.
- [[05-pmbok/7-pmbok/models-methods-artifacts/index|Models, methods, and artifacts (MMAs)]] — Compact list of MMAs and where they commonly show up in stems.
