# Ways of Working

PMBOK 7 recognizes that there is no single best approach to managing projects. Instead, it highlights multiple **ways of working**—predictive, adaptive, and hybrid—that project teams can tailor to fit their context. **Predictive (waterfall)** approaches emphasize upfront planning, defined scope, and sequential phases. **Adaptive (agile/iterative)** approaches focus on flexibility, incremental delivery, and continuous stakeholder feedback. **Hybrid** blends these elements, using predictive structure where stability is needed and adaptive practices where uncertainty is high.  

This flexibility reflects PMBOK 7’s value-driven focus: the method must serve the project’s objectives, not the other way around. For exam prep, recognizing cues that signal whether a predictive, adaptive, or hybrid approach is appropriate is essential.  

This placeholder ensures the link is functional. A complete version will provide practical examples, exam signals, and comparisons to how PMBOK 6 framed methodology choices.
