# Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity

PMBOK 7 highlights **uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity** as distinct but related conditions that affect every project. **Uncertainty** refers to situations where information is incomplete or outcomes are unpredictable. **Complexity** arises from the interconnectedness of factors such as technology, stakeholders, or interdependent systems. **Ambiguity** occurs when information can be interpreted in multiple ways, creating confusion about meaning or intent.  

Recognizing these conditions helps project managers select the right responses. For example, ambiguity may call for clarification workshops, uncertainty may require iterative planning, and complexity may need systems thinking or specialized expertise. PMBOK 7 places these ideas within its broader focus on tailoring and value delivery, encouraging teams to adapt methods that best address the challenge at hand.  

This placeholder ensures the page is active. The finished version will provide detailed examples, exam cues, and strategies for distinguishing between uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity.
