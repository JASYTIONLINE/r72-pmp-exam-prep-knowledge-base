# Models, Methods, and Artifacts (MMAs)

PMBOK 7 introduces the concept of **Models, Methods, and Artifacts (MMAs)** as practical tools project teams can draw upon to tailor their approach. **Models** are representations or frameworks that help visualize concepts (for example, a stakeholder grid or process model). **Methods** are structured approaches for accomplishing work, such as forecasting, prototyping, or root cause analysis. **Artifacts** are tangible deliverables like registers, reports, or logs that capture project information.  

Unlike PMBOK 6, which embedded artifacts within ITTO outputs, PMBOK 7 treats MMAs as a flexible toolbox. Teams can select the MMAs that best fit their context, aligning with the principle of tailoring and the focus on value delivery.  

This placeholder confirms the page link is active. Future versions will expand with categorized lists of MMAs, study strategies for recognizing them on the exam, and real-world examples of how they add structure to project management practice.
