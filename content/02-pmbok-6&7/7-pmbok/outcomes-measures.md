# Outcomes & Measures

PMBOK 7 shifts attention from simply producing deliverables to ensuring that projects create **outcomes** that generate value. Outcomes describe the real-world effects of project work, such as improved customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, or regulatory compliance. **Measures** are the metrics used to assess whether those outcomes have been achieved and whether they are “fit for use.”  

Traditional success criteria—scope, schedule, and cost—remain important, but PMBOK 7 broadens the view to include **benefits realization and value delivery**. For example, delivering a system on time and on budget is less meaningful if stakeholders cannot use it effectively or if it fails to deliver expected benefits.  

This placeholder ensures the page is active. Future content will provide examples of outcome-focused measures, contrast PMBOK 6 vs. 7 perspectives, and offer exam cues for identifying when questions are testing “value delivered” rather than “deliverables completed.”
