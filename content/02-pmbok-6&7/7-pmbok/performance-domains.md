# Performance Domains

Performance domains are broad areas of focus that guide how projects deliver outcomes in PMBOK 7. Unlike the process groups of PMBOK 6, domains are not sequential steps but **interrelated spheres of activity** that must be balanced throughout a project’s life cycle. Examples include stakeholder engagement, team development, planning and delivery, measurement, and navigating uncertainty. Each domain highlights the conditions and behaviors needed to support value delivery.  

For exam prep, performance domains provide a framework for reasoning through situational questions. Instead of asking “which process comes next,” PMBOK 7 challenges students to evaluate whether a situation aligns with effective stakeholder practices, governance boundaries, or delivery focus.  

This placeholder ensures the page is functional. A finished version will include concise definitions of all domains, study cues for distinguishing them, and examples showing how domains interact in real project contexts.
