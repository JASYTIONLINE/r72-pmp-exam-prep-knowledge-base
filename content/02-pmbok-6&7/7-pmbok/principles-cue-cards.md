# Principles Cue Cards

Cue cards are a proven study technique for breaking down PMBOK 7’s twelve principles into short, test-ready prompts. Instead of memorizing long definitions, cue cards capture the **essence of each principle in a single line or phrase**. For example, “Stewardship = act responsibly for future outcomes” or “Tailoring = adapt practices to context.” By reducing complexity, students can rehearse these cards quickly and recall them under exam pressure.  

PMBOK 7’s principle-driven model makes cue cards especially effective because it rewards understanding broad themes rather than memorizing ITTOs. Cue cards also support **active recall**, a technique where you test yourself repeatedly until responses are automatic.  

This placeholder confirms the page is active. Future development will include printable cue cards, digital flashcard sets, and side-by-side examples showing how each principle can be phrased for rapid memory and applied in case-study scenarios.
