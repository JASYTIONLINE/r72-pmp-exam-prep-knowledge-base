# Value Delivery System

The **value delivery system** in PMBOK 7 shifts focus from delivering outputs to ensuring outcomes that create tangible benefits for stakeholders. It emphasizes that projects are not isolated activities but part of a larger organizational system designed to generate value. Value is delivered through portfolios, programs, and projects working together, supported by governance and organizational enablers.  

Instead of measuring success only by scope, schedule, and cost, PMBOK 7 encourages project managers to consider whether the results are sustainable, aligned with strategy, and meaningful to end users. This makes concepts like benefits realization and fitness-for-use central to project success.  

This placeholder confirms the page is live. Future content will expand with examples of value streams, illustrations of how value delivery links to performance domains, and exam cues highlighting the difference between output-focused and outcome-focused measures.
