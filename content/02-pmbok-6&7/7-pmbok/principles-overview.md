# Principles Overview

PMBOK 7 is organized around guiding principles rather than prescriptive processes. The **twelve principles** provide a value-based foundation for how projects should be led, tailored, and delivered. These include ideas such as stewardship, stakeholder engagement, team collaboration, value delivery, systems thinking, and adaptability. Instead of focusing on “what to do next,” the principles emphasize **mindsets and behaviors** that support project success across industries and delivery approaches.  

For students, the principles act as anchors: each principle frames how decisions are made and how processes from earlier PMBOK editions can be adapted. For practitioners, they encourage thoughtful tailoring to context rather than rigid application.  

This placeholder page ensures the link is live and functional. In its final form, it will expand with concise definitions for each principle, memory cues for exam preparation, and examples showing how principles translate into real-world project choices.
