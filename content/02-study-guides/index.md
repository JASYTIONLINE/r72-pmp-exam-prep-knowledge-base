## What is this Guidebook?
A DAIS-style **guidebook** inside the larger DIAL Library: dense, fact-only notes organized by PMI concepts (not by video). Each topic lives in its own `.md` for fast retrieval.

---

## How it Works
- Every folder has an `index.md` (navigation) and `readme.md` (purpose). :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
- Index pages use the standard sections and links pattern for consistency. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
- Internal references are Obsidian links; user-friendly names can start as `TBD` and be refined as the Guidebook matures.

## What is the DIAL Library?
A curated, versioned collection of Obsidian notes and references that DAIS policies cite “by reference.” Each collection has its own index/readme and uses uniform front matter.

---

## How it Works
- All folders contain `index.md` (navigation) and `readme.md` (purpose, contents, usage). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- Index pages follow the standard section layout for clarity and traversal. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- Internal links use `[[path/folder|User Name]]` so moves auto-update in Obsidian.

---

## Notes
- Canon docs cite the Library rather than restating standards.
- Keep files machine-readable `.md` or provide an `.md` index page for binaries.
