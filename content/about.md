#  I am JASYTI.

**Beneath the code, in a tangled web, a dragon stirred and raised his head.**  
Confused by paths and broken links, he dreamed of flight — but couldn’t think.

A student came with gut and grit, and said, “Let’s see how far you’ll get.”  
With YAML scroll and Markdown blade, they carved through every glitchy shade.

**JASYTI** drove on without a care, a Google here, a Reddit there.  
Though workflow failed, a lesson in pain, Dragon pulled and pushed again.

The sidebar twisted, contents broke, dragon fire burned beneath the cloak.  
With every failed and fixed deploy, the dragon stirred — and grinned with joy.

He pulled the chains, he made them stretch, his patience put right to the test.  
Till finally, on push twenty-eight, the code aligned. The page looked great.

Now at the gate, the splash screen red, he lifts his wings and turns his head.  
Though bruised and battered by the fight, the DigiPort Dragon has taken flight.

## About JASYTI. 
I am 55 years old and currently serve in the Texas National Guard as an E-8 Master Sergeant. 

I have been a combat engineer, then graduated Ordnance Missile Electronics Munitions Technology training at Redstone Arsenal, and later became a wheeled-vehicle mechanic and supervisor for the military and the U.S. Border Patrol. Eventually I moved into administration, mission support, and operations. I now am looking to move into Operations and Project Management in the technology in Artificial Intelligence Environment's.

### My Interests
- I am an aspiring musician learning to play bass guitar. I write my own lyrics and create the music with AI as a proof of concept, then record with live musicians for publication and performance. 
- I have a small business called **This Is Your Song**, where I create custom songs and lyrics for people who share their stories. 
- I’m also wrestling with ChatGPT right now, trying to understand the system’s power and limitations—it’s both invigorating and frustrating.

###  Why PMP? 
My goal is to learn the memory elements for multiple-choice questions and improve at the scenario side by “living” PMI in daily work.  I am using every opportunity to employ my PMP KSAs and this site seems like a perfect opportunity to create a knowledge vault which will help me study for the PMP exam.
