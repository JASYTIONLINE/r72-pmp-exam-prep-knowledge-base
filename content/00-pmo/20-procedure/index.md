# Procedures

## BLUF
This folder defines the **how-to workflows** for Project PASS PMP.  
Procedures translate policies into **repeatable steps** so execution is consistent.

## Contents
- Daily Workflow: Study → Draft → Revise → ECO Wire → Publish
- Cross-Linking Procedure: sideways, upward (ECO), downward (glossary/resources)
- Publishing Procedure: Obsidian → Quartz → GitHub Pages
- Change Request Procedure: confirm with sponsor before scope/numbering changes

## How to Use
Follow these procedures during daily execution and weekly sprint reviews.  
If a step cannot be followed (e.g., transcript missing), escalate to the sponsor before continuing.
