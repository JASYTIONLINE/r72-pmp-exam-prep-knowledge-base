# Guidance and Internal Docs

## BLUF
This folder collects the **internal guidance documents** that explain how the PMP PASS site works behind the scenes.  
They provide orientation for new readers, context for prospective employers, and scaffolding for students who want to copy or extend the process.  
Unlike lessons or resources, these are **meta-documents** — about the project, its structure, and its governance.

## Contents
- [[10-course-introduction|Course Introduction]] — Purpose of the site and how it supports PMP study.  
- [[20-about-jasyti|About JASYTI]] — Author background, motivations, and goals.  
- [[30-agenda|Agenda]] — Locked Tue–Fri cadence; the master controller for execution.  

### Linked Governance Logs
- [[60-risk-log|Risk Log]] — Tracks identified risks, ECO mapping, responses, and status.  
- [[40-change-log|Change Log]] — Records structural/content changes (e.g., PMBOK 7 → PMBOK 8).  
- [[70-lessons-learned|Lessons Learned Log]] — Weekly retrospectives and improvements.
