## Day 0 — Preface

### BLUF
This agenda is the **master controller** for the PMP study site. Following each day’s checklist will result in a **fully populated, exam-aligned knowledge base**.

### How to Use
- **Cadence SoT:** Mirrors locked Excel schedule (Tue–Fri). Each class = one sprint.
- **Daily Workflow:** Study → Draft (BLUF/SLOs/bullets/refs) → Live notes → Revise → **Wire ECO** (up/side/down links) → **Publish** (Obsidian → Quartz → GH Pages).
- **Weekly Focus:**  
  Week 1: skeleton & resources · Week 2: lesson stubs/anchors · Week 3–4: cross-links, glossary, exam-prep · Week 5: integration, backlog triage, Lessons Learned.
- **Governance:** Numbering locked; **ask before scope/number changes**; after commit, edits only in Obsidian.

- [ ] **Publish** → Obsidian → Quartz → GH Pages; verify links resolve  

#### WBS — Phase 1 carry-forward (infrastructure & clarity pages today)
- [ ] **Resources skeleton (clarity pages)** — create minimal “open for business” stubs:

  - [[pmp/500-resources/540-pmbok-crosswalk]] (title + purpose line; no content yet)  
  - [[pmp/500-resources/550-bibliography]] (shell with “approved sources” list)  

- [ ] **Prompt Library stubs** — under `pmp/500-resources/prompts/` create: 
	- [ ] transcript-to-lesson.md` — purpose + steps + mini-checklist

#### Definition of Done (today)
- [ ] Today’s `110-foundation.md` meets style/acceptance criteria and is **published**  
- [ ] Upward ECO anchors linked; `eco: [...]` present in front matter
