Acceptance (risk response),gloss-acceptance-risk,A,"We document acceptance and keep a small contingency in reserve.","Acceptance means we choose to live with a risk, document it, and (for active acceptance) set aside contingency instead of taking preventive action now.","If treatment costs outweigh likely impact, acceptance is reasonable. Passive = document/monitor. Active = add contingency + trigger. Don’t jump to avoid/mitigate without evidence.",\[\[pmp/200-process/280-risk]],draft,Y

Acceptance criteria,gloss-acceptance-criteria,A,"We won’t call the job done until the acceptance criteria are met.","Acceptance criteria are the specific, testable conditions that must be met before a deliverable is approved by the customer or sponsor.","On questions about 'done,' pick Validate Scope using acceptance criteria.

Accepted deliverables,gloss-accepted-deliverables,A,"With accepted deliverables signed off, we move to closure.","Accepted deliverables are verified outputs that have received formal approval from the authorized stakeholder.","After acceptance, deliverables feed Close Project/Phase; they’re not re-tested unless a change request reopens them. Don’t confuse accepted (approved) with verified (checked).",\[\[pmp/200-process/220-scope]],draft,Y

Actual Cost (AC),gloss-actual-cost,A,"Actual Cost (AC) jumps this sprint after the rush license.","Actual Cost (AC) is the amount of money the project actually spent on the work completed during the period you’re measuring.","Remember CPI = EV ÷ AC and CV = EV − AC. Rising AC without EV growth lowers CPI and makes CV more negative. If asked 'spent so far,' AC is the number—not PV or EV.",\[\[pmp/200-process/240-cost]],draft,Y

Acquire resources (process),gloss-acquire-resources,A,"We acquire resources later than planned and adjust the calendar.","Acquire Resources is the process of getting the people, equipment, and materials the project needs to perform the work.","Outputs include resource assignments and calendars.

Expect scenario mini-calcs.",\[\[pmp/200-process/240-cost]],draft,Y

Application area,gloss-application-area,A,"We tailor governance to the application area.","The application area is the industry/discipline context that shapes practices (e.g., healthcare, construction).","Tailor; don’t copy-paste processes. OPAs/EEMs differ by domain.",\[\[pmp/200-process/210-methods-overview]],draft,Y

Approved change request,gloss-approved-change,A,"Once approved, we implement the change at the right boundary.","An approved change request is a CCB-approved modification to a baseline or product.","Implement via Direct \& Manage Project Work; update baselines through Perform Integrated Change Control.",\[\[pmp/200-process/298-change-control]],draft,Y

Artifact,gloss-artifact,A,"We keep key artifacts visible and versioned.","An artifact is any project work product (document, model, code, test result).","High-value artifacts should be accessible and under configuration control.",\[\[pmp/300-people/340-empower]],draft,Y

Assumption,gloss-assumption,A,"We log assumptions so we can test them later.","An assumption is a factor accepted as true for planning without full proof.","Assumptions breed risk; track them and validate early. Don’t confuse with constraints.",\[\[pmp/200-process/280-risk]],draft,Y

Assumption log,gloss-assumption-log,A,"The assumption log becomes our early-warning system.","An assumption log records assumptions and constraints with owners, dates, and follow-ups.","Living input to risk management; exam may ask where it’s created/updated.",\[\[pmp/200-process/280-risk]],draft,Y

Audit (quality),gloss-quality-audit,A,"A quality audit exposes gaps we can fix before the customer finds them.","A quality audit is a structured review to confirm project activities comply with policies and procedures.","Expect outputs like recommendations and change requests; not the same as inspection.",\[\[pmp/200-process/270-quality]],draft,Y

Authority,gloss-authority,A,"Clear authority prevents stalls and rework.","Authority is the legitimate power to make decisions and commit resources.","Exam loves sponsor vs. PM authority boundaries; escalate when decisions exceed your authority.",\[\[pmp/300-people/320-lead-team]],draft,Y

Accuracy (vs precision),gloss-accuracy,A,"We need accuracy first; precision without truth misleads.","Accuracy means results are close to the true value; precision means results are close to each other.","If asked to choose, pick the one that meets customer’s acceptance criteria (often accuracy).",\[\[pmp/200-process/270-quality]],draft,Y

Backlog,gloss-backlog,B,"We shape the Backlog like a storyboard so value lands first.","A backlog is an ordered list of work items that represent upcoming value for users or stakeholders.","Order by value, risk, and learning.

Balanced scorecard,gloss-balanced-scorecard,B,"We balanced the scorecard so speed doesn’t erase quality.","A balanced scorecard is a performance framework that tracks multiple perspectives (financial, customer, internal, learning).","Use when questions ask for holistic measures beyond cost/schedule; aligns to governance and strategy.",\[\[pmp/100-business-environment/120-strategic-alignment]],draft,Y

Baseline,gloss-baseline,B,"We protect the Baseline and route changes through the gate.","A baseline is the approved plan (scope, schedule, cost) used to manage and measure performance.","Changes require Perform Integrated Change Control. Don’t stealth-edit baselines when variance appears.",\[\[pmp/200-process/298-change-control]],draft,Y

Basis of estimates (BoE),gloss-basis-of-estimates,B,"We write the Basis of Estimates so future us knows why.","The basis of estimates explains how estimates were developed, including assumptions, constraints, and data sources.","Expect questions about transparency/credibility; BoE supports risk and change decisions.",\[\[pmp/200-process/240-cost]] · \[\[pmp/200-process/230-schedule]],draft,Y

Benefits realization management,gloss-benefits-realization,B,"We run benefits like a product, not a one-time event.","Benefits realization management is the practice of ensuring intended benefits are delivered and sustained over time.","Expect lifecycle language: plan → deliver → transition → sustain; responsibilities may outlive the project.",\[\[pmp/100-business-environment/130-benefits-and-value]],draft,Y

Benchmarking,gloss-benchmarking,B,"We benchmark against leaders to set realistic targets.","Benchmarking compares practices or results against peers or industry leaders to identify improvements.","Used in quality, cost, and schedule targets. Watch for OPAs vs. EEFs in data sources.",\[\[pmp/200-process/270-quality]],draft,Y

Bidder conference,gloss-bidder-conference,B,"We ran a bidder conference to level the playing field.","A bidder conference is a meeting with prospective sellers to clarify procurement documents and requirements.","Goal is fairness and shared understanding. Answers should reduce ambiguity and favoritism risks.",\[\[pmp/200-process/295-procurement]],draft,Y

BCR (benefit–cost ratio),gloss-bcr,B,"We checked BCR so we don’t chase negative value.","Benefit–cost ratio compares expected benefits to expected costs to judge economic viability.","Positive and >1 is good; combine with NPV/IRR reasoning. Don’t let BCR alone trump strategic fit.",\[\[pmp/100-business-environment/130-benefits-and-value]],draft,Y

Beta (PERT distribution),gloss-beta-pert,B,"We used a beta distribution to tame the estimate spread.","The beta distribution underlies PERT’s weighted average for three-point estimates.","PERT mean = (O + 4M + P) ÷ 6; variance ≈ ((P − O)/6)^2. Expect small math, concept-heavy.",\[\[pmp/200-process/230-schedule]],draft,Y

Bid (proposal),gloss-bid,B,"We scored each bid against weighted criteria, not gut feel.","A bid (proposal) is a seller’s offer describing how they will meet the buyer’s need at a stated cost/schedule.","Use objective evaluation criteria; keep procurement auditable and fair.",\[\[pmp/200-process/295-procurement]],draft,Y

Bottom-up estimating,gloss-bottom-up-estimating,B,"We rolled estimates up from the smallest pieces.","Bottom-up estimating aggregates detailed estimates from lower-level components to total work packages and control accounts.","Most accurate, most effort.

Buffer (schedule),gloss-buffer-schedule,B,"We added feeding buffers to protect the critical chain.","A schedule buffer is reserved time inserted to absorb variability without changing delivery dates.","Critical chain uses project and feeding buffers; don’t confuse with contingency vs. management reserve.",\[\[pmp/200-process/230-schedule]],draft,Y

Burndown chart,gloss-burndown,B,"The burndown told us scope creep was hiding in plain sight.","A burndown chart shows remaining work versus time across an iteration or release.","Falling line = progress; flat/rising = scope or velocity issues. Don’t misuse as a personal productivity tracker.",\[\[pmp/200-process/210-methods-overview]],draft,Y

Burnup chart,gloss-burnup,B,"The burnup proved we expanded scope faster than velocity.","A burnup chart tracks completed work against total scope to show both progress and scope change.","Clearer than burndown when scope moves. Use to discuss trade-offs with stakeholders.",\[\[pmp/200-process/210-methods-overview]],draft,Y

Business case,gloss-business-case,B,"We kept the business case open and honest when risks rose.","The business case explains why the project is worth doing, including strategic fit, options, costs, and benefits.","Treat as a living input.

Business value,gloss-business-value,B,"We measured business value, not just outputs and hours.","Business value is the net benefit to the organization and stakeholders from outcomes delivered by the project.","Favor outcomes over outputs; value can be financial or non-financial (risk reduction, compliance, satisfaction).",\[\[pmp/100-business-environment/130-benefits-and-value]],draft,Y

Buyer (vs seller),gloss-buyer,B,"As the buyer, we set fair terms and enforced them evenly.","The buyer is the organization acquiring goods or services; the seller provides them under contract.","Know role boundaries, contract types, and ethics. The PM protects fairness and outcomes, not favorite vendors.",\[\[pmp/200-process/295-procurement]],draft,Y

Blocker (impediment),gloss-blocker,B,"We surfaced blockers early so the team didn’t stall silently.","A blocker (impediment) is anything that prevents progress until it is removed or worked around.","Adaptive contexts escalate blockers via the Scrum Master/Team; predictive contexts use issue logs and escalation paths.",\[\[pmp/300-people/310-support-performance]] · \[\[pmp/200-process/210-methods-overview]],draft,Y

CCB (Change Control Board),gloss-ccb,C,"We routed the change to the CCB so the baseline stays trustworthy.","A Change Control Board (CCB) is a group that reviews, approves, defers, or rejects change requests to baselines or products.","Expect governance: the PM prepares impact analysis; the CCB decides. Don’t implement before approval unless the plan allows emergency changes.",\[\[pmp/200-process/298-change-control]],draft,Y

Cause-and-effect diagram (Ishikawa),gloss-cause-effect,C,"We sketched a cause-and-effect diagram to chase the defect back to source.","A cause-and-effect diagram organizes potential root causes into categories so the team can investigate systematically.","Pairs with the 5 Whys. Use in quality/problem-solving scenes, not to assign blame.",\[\[pmp/200-process/270-quality]],draft,Y

Change log,gloss-change-log,C,"We updated the change log so everyone can see decisions and status.","A change log tracks all change requests, their decisions, and implementation status.","Transparency matters. Exam favors auditable records over side agreements.",\[\[pmp/200-process/298-change-control]],draft,Y

Change request,gloss-change-request,C,"We raised a change request instead of quietly moving the date.","A change request is a formal proposal to modify scope, schedule, cost, quality, or product.","Perform Integrated Change Control evaluates impact first; implementation follows approval.",\[\[pmp/200-process/298-change-control]],draft,Y

Collect Requirements (process),gloss-collect-requirements,C,"We collected requirements with workshops, interviews, and prototypes.","Collect Requirements elicits and documents stakeholder needs and constraints to define scope.","Outputs include requirements documentation and a traceability matrix. Don’t confuse with Define Scope.",\[\[pmp/200-process/220-scope]],draft,Y

Communications management plan,gloss-comms-plan,C,"We built the communications plan so the right people hear the right things on time.","The communications management plan defines what, when, how, and to whom project information flows.","Match channel/cadence to stakeholder needs. Noise is risk; tailor intensity.",\[\[pmp/200-process/250-communications]],draft,Y

Compliance,gloss-compliance,C,"We proved compliance before audit day instead of hoping for mercy.","Compliance means conforming to laws, regulations, standards, or policies that apply to the project or product.","If it’s mandatory, it’s not a trade-off. Expect answers that escalate non-compliance risks.",\[\[pmp/100-business-environment/150-governance]],draft,Y

Complexity,gloss-complexity,C,"We treated complexity as a risk amplifier and designed for simplicity.","Complexity is the degree of interdependence, novelty, uncertainty, and social factors that make outcomes harder to predict.","High complexity → smaller batches, shorter feedback loops, stronger integration cadence.",\[\[pmp/200-process/210-methods-overview]],draft,Y

Constraint,gloss-constraint,C,"We planned within constraints instead of pretending they’d move later.","A constraint is a limiting factor (date, budget, resources, regulation) that narrows options.","Don’t confuse with assumptions. Constraints feed baselines and risk planning.",\[\[pmp/200-process/240-cost]] · \[\[pmp/200-process/230-schedule]],draft,Y

Configuration management plan,gloss-config-mgmt-plan,C,"We locked configuration rules so artifacts don’t drift in the wild.","The configuration management plan defines how versions, baselines, and changes to artifacts are identified, stored, and controlled.","Different from change control scope; config control tracks the \*product\* items.",\[\[pmp/200-process/298-change-control]],draft,Y

Conflict management,gloss-conflict-management,C,"We surfaced conflict early and solved the issue, not the person.","Conflict management is the set of approaches to address disagreements constructively.","Collaborate/problem-solve beats force/avoid in most exam scenarios unless time is critical.",\[\[pmp/300-people/310-support-performance]],draft,Y

Constraint (triple),gloss-triple-constraint,C,"We balanced scope, schedule, and cost—the triple constraint—without gutting quality.","The triple constraint highlights the trade-offs among scope, schedule, and cost (with quality as a core consideration).","When one moves, others respond. Use change control to keep integrity.",\[\[pmp/200-process/210-methods-overview]],draft,Y

Contingency,gloss-contingency,C,"We protected delivery with contingency instead of betting on luck.","Contingency is the time and/or money reserved to handle known-unknown risks (baked into baselines).","Distinguish from management reserve (unknown-unknowns, outside PM control).",\[\[pmp/200-process/240-cost]] · \[\[pmp/200-process/280-risk]],draft,Y

Contingency reserve,gloss-contingency-reserve,C,"We drew from the contingency reserve when the risk actually occurred.","A contingency reserve is a budget/time allowance set aside to respond to identified risks if they happen.","Access per plan; it’s part of the baseline, not a slush fund.",\[\[pmp/200-process/240-cost]] · \[\[pmp/200-process/280-risk]],draft,Y

Control account,gloss-control-account,C,"We rolled performance up at the control account to keep reporting tight.","A control account is a management control point where scope, budget, and schedule are integrated and performance measured.","Think EV aggregation point.

Control Scope (process),gloss-control-scope,C,"We controlled scope creep with traceability instead of heroics.","Control Scope monitors scope status and manages changes to the scope baseline.","Use the requirements traceability matrix; unapproved scope becomes change requests.",\[\[pmp/200-process/220-scope]],draft,Y

Control Schedule (process),gloss-control-schedule,C,"We controlled schedule variance by adjusting near-term work, not hand-waving.","Control Schedule monitors schedule status and manages changes to the schedule baseline.","Use performance data, forecasts, and approved changes; avoid stealth slips.",\[\[pmp/200-process/230-schedule]],draft,Y

Control Costs (process),gloss-control-costs,C,"We controlled costs by acting on trends before they became headlines.","Control Costs monitors cost performance and manages changes to the cost baseline.","Bring EVM to the party: CPI, CV, EAC, VAC. Approve changes before re-baselining.",\[\[pmp/200-process/240-cost]],draft,Y

Cost baseline,gloss-cost-baseline,C,"We guarded the cost baseline like an agreement with the future.","The cost baseline is the time-phased project budget, including contingency reserves but excluding management reserves.","Variance against it requires analysis and formal change control to adjust.",\[\[pmp/200-process/240-cost]],draft,Y

Cost of Quality (COQ),gloss-coq,C,"We invested in prevention because COQ made the math obvious.","Cost of Quality combines prevention/appraisal (conformance) and internal/external failure (non-conformance) costs.","Exam leans toward prevention and early detection over late fixes.",\[\[pmp/200-process/270-quality]],draft,Y

Cost performance index (CPI),gloss-cpi,C,"Our CPI told us the story faster than a status novel.","CPI measures cost efficiency: Earned Value divided by Actual Cost (EV ÷ AC).","CPI < 1 is over budget; > 1 is under. Use with EAC forecasting logic.",\[\[pmp/200-process/240-cost]],draft,Y

Cost variance (CV),gloss-cv,C,"CV went negative when spend outpaced progress.","Cost variance is EV minus AC (EV − AC), showing budget overrun or underrun.","Negative is bad (overrun). Tie interpretation to management action, not blame.",\[\[pmp/200-process/240-cost]],draft,Y

Crashing,gloss-crashing,C,"We crashed the schedule only where extra cost bought real time.","Crashing adds resources or cost to reduce duration on the critical path.","Use after analyzing cost–time trade-offs; it often increases risk and expense.",\[\[pmp/200-process/230-schedule]],draft,Y

Critical chain method,gloss-critical-chain,C,"We switched to critical chain and protected flow with feeding buffers.","Critical chain focuses on resource constraints and buffer management to protect delivery dates.","Buffers replace padded tasks; manage buffer burn instead of micromanaging tasks.",\[\[pmp/200-process/230-schedule]],draft,Y

Critical path,gloss-critical-path,C,"We guarded the critical path so the date doesn’t slip silently.","The critical path is the longest path through the network with zero total float; it sets the project duration.","Expect fast-tracking/crashing trade-offs and float questions.",\[\[pmp/200-process/230-schedule]],draft,Y

Cumulative flow diagram (CFD),gloss-cfd,C,"The CFD showed work piling in ‘In-Progress,’ so we cut WIP.","A cumulative flow diagram visualizes arrival, work-in-progress, and completion over time to reveal flow and bottlenecks.","Adaptive lens: limit WIP, remove blockers, stabilize flow before adding scope.",\[\[pmp/200-process/210-methods-overview]],draft,Y

Daily stand-up,gloss-daily-standup,D,"We used the Daily stand-up to unblock work instead of reporting to a boss.","A daily stand-up is a short team sync focused on flow, blockers, and next steps—not status to management.","Keep it timeboxed and team-owned. On exams, favor collaboration and impediment removal over detailed reporting.",\[\[pmp/200-process/210-methods-overview]],draft,Y

Data analysis,gloss-data-analysis,D,"We ran data analysis before committing to a costly pivot.","Data analysis covers techniques to examine information and draw actionable conclusions.","PMI wants evidence-based decisions.

Definition of Done (DoD),gloss-definition-of-done,D,"We hardened the Definition of Done so ‘done’ really shipped value.","Definition of Done is a shared checklist that determines when work is truly complete and releasable.","Exam favors clear DoD to prevent hidden work. Don’t confuse with acceptance criteria (customer-facing).",\[\[pmp/200-process/210-methods-overview]],draft,Y

Definition of Ready (DoR),gloss-definition-of-ready,D,"We enforced a Definition of Ready so sprint planning wasn’t wish-casting.","Definition of Ready lists conditions a backlog item must meet before the team can commit to it.","Use to reduce thrash; aligns with just-in-time detail.
