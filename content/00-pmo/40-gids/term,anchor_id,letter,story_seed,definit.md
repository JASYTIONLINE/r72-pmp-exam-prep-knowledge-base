Acceptance (risk response),gloss-acceptance-risk,A,"We document acceptance and keep a small contingency in reserve.","Acceptance means we choose to live with a risk, document it, and (for active acceptance) set aside contingency instead of taking preventive action now.","If treatment costs outweigh likely impact, acceptance is reasonable. Passive = document/monitor. Active = add contingency + trigger. Don’t jump to avoid/mitigate without evidence.",[[pmp/200-process/280-risk]],draft,Y
Acceptance criteria,gloss-acceptance-criteria,A,"We won’t call the job done until the acceptance criteria are met.","Acceptance criteria are the specific, testable conditions that must be met before a deliverable is approved by the customer or sponsor.","On questions about 'done,' pick Validate Scope using acceptance criteria. Control Quality verifies correctness; it does not grant acceptance. If criteria aren’t met, expect rework or a change request.",[[pmp/200-process/220-scope]],draft,Y
Accepted deliverables,gloss-accepted-deliverables,A,"With accepted deliverables signed off, we move to closure.","Accepted deliverables are verified outputs that have received formal approval from the authorized stakeholder.","After acceptance, deliverables feed Close Project/Phase; they’re not re-tested unless a change request reopens them. Don’t confuse accepted (approved) with verified (checked).",[[pmp/200-process/220-scope]],draft,Y
Actual Cost (AC),gloss-actual-cost,A,"Actual Cost (AC) jumps this sprint after the rush license.","Actual Cost (AC) is the amount of money the project actually spent on the work completed during the period you’re measuring.","Remember CPI = EV ÷ AC and CV = EV − AC. Rising AC without EV growth lowers CPI and makes CV more negative. If asked 'spent so far,' AC is the number—not PV or EV.",[[pmp/200-process/240-cost]],draft,Y
Acquire resources (process),gloss-acquire-resources,A,"We acquire resources later than planned and adjust the calendar.","Acquire Resources is the process of getting the people, equipment, and materials the project needs to perform the work.","Outputs include resource assignments and calendars. Don’t mix with Develop Team (improving people) or Manage Team (day-to-day leadership). If resources aren’t available, escalate or revisit the plan via change control.",[[pmp/200-process/260-resources]],draft,Y
Activity,gloss-activity,A,"We break the work into activities we can actually schedule.","An activity is a scheduled unit of work that consumes time/resources and produces an output.","Defined from WBS work packages. Drives sequencing, estimating, and the network diagram.",[[pmp/200-process/230-schedule]],draft,Y
Activity attributes,gloss-activity-attributes,A,"We capture the details—leads, lags, predecessors—inside the activity attributes.","Activity attributes are the metadata about each activity (IDs, leads/lags, predecessors, resources, calendars, constraints).","Used for sequencing, estimating, and resource planning. Expect exam items about where these fields live.",[[pmp/200-process/230-schedule]],draft,Y
Activity duration estimate,gloss-activity-duration,A,"We timebox uncertainty with three-point duration estimates.","An activity duration estimate is the time required to complete an activity with assigned resources.","PERT/triangular, analogous, parametric, bottom-up—pick by data and stage; near-term work gets the most precision.",[[pmp/200-process/230-schedule]],draft,Y
Activity list,gloss-activity-list,A,"We baseline the activity list before building the network.","The activity list is the comprehensive set of scheduled activities with identifiers and scope descriptions.","Output of Define Activities; input to sequencing and estimating. Expect 'which process outputs this?' style questions.",[[pmp/200-process/230-schedule]],draft,Y
Activity network diagram (AoN/PDM),gloss-activity-network,A,"The diagram exposes the critical and near-critical paths we must protect.","An activity network diagram (AoN/PDM) shows activity dependencies and flow using nodes and logical relationships.","Identifies critical path and float; know FS/SS/FF/SF logic and how changes affect duration.",[[pmp/200-process/230-schedule]],draft,Y
Adaptive (life cycle),gloss-adaptive-life-cycle,A,"We choose an adaptive cadence to learn fast and pivot safely.","An adaptive life cycle delivers in short increments, embraces change, and prioritizes frequent value delivery.","Scope flexes; time/cost are often fixed (timeboxing). Requirements emerge; planning is rolling-wave.",[[pmp/200-process/210-methods-overview]],draft,Y
Adaptive planning,gloss-adaptive-planning,A,"Backlog refinement is our weekly adaptive planning checkpoint.","Adaptive planning revisits scope and priorities just-in-time each iteration.","Progressive elaboration; plan near-term work in detail and keep options open for later.",[[pmp/200-process/210-methods-overview]],draft,Y
ADKAR (change framework),gloss-adkar,A,"Training targets Knowledge and Ability in ADKAR.","ADKAR stands for Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, Reinforcement—steps for organizational change.","Use for org change scenarios, not for baseline change control. Tie interventions to missing letters.",[[pmp/100-business-environment/140-culture-and-change]],draft,Y
Agile (mindset),gloss-agile,A,"We favor working results and collaboration over heavy process.","Agile is a mindset emphasizing value, collaboration, responsiveness, and frequent delivery.","Choose options that maximize learning and value. Don’t treat ceremonies as goals; they serve outcomes.",[[pmp/200-process/210-methods-overview]],draft,Y
Agile ceremonies,gloss-agile-ceremonies,A,"The retrospective is where we actually improve, not just report.","Agile ceremonies are inspect-and-adapt events like planning, daily stand-up, review/demo, and retrospective.","Know the purpose of each and how they feed value; avoid cargo-cult ceremony use.",[[pmp/200-process/210-methods-overview]],draft,Y
Agile Center of Excellence (ACoE),gloss-acoe,A,"We lean on the ACoE for coaching and shared practices.","An Agile Center of Excellence is a group that coaches and standardizes agile practices across teams.","Treat as an OPA that improves delivery; expect questions about scaling and consistency.",[[pmp/100-business-environment/150-governance]],draft,Y
Agile Manifesto,gloss-agile-manifesto,A,"Values first: left-side beats right-side when tradeoffs arise.","The Agile Manifesto defines four values and twelve principles for agile delivery.","When in doubt, align decisions to the values; avoid weaponizing process over outcomes.",[[pmp/200-process/210-methods-overview]],draft,Y
Agile release planning,gloss-agile-release-planning,A,"We sketch features by release to land value predictably.","Agile release planning sequences features over multiple iterations to set release goals.","Order by value, risk, and learning. MVP first; keep feedback loops tight.",[[pmp/200-process/230-schedule]],draft,Y
Affinity diagram,gloss-affinity-diagram,A,"We cluster noisy ideas into themes with an affinity diagram.","An affinity diagram groups related ideas to reveal themes and structure.","Expect uses in brainstorming and root-cause sessions; pairs well with cause-and-effect diagrams.",[[pmp/200-process/298-change-control]],draft,Y
Analogous estimating,gloss-analogous-estimating,A,"We estimate fast by analogy to past projects.","Analogous estimating is a top-down method using historicals from similar work.","Faster, less accurate; best early when detail is thin. Calibrate with expert judgment.",[[pmp/200-process/240-cost]],draft,Y
Analytical techniques,gloss-analytical-techniques,A,"We run what-if and sensitivity to stress the plan.","Analytical techniques include trend, regression, what-if, and sensitivity analyses.","Use to justify choices across cost, schedule, quality, and risk. Expect scenario mini-calcs.",[[pmp/200-process/240-cost]],draft,Y
Application area,gloss-application-area,A,"We tailor governance to the application area.","The application area is the industry/discipline context that shapes practices (e.g., healthcare, construction).","Tailor; don’t copy-paste processes. OPAs/EEMs differ by domain.",[[pmp/200-process/210-methods-overview]],draft,Y
Approved change request,gloss-approved-change,A,"Once approved, we implement the change at the right boundary.","An approved change request is a CCB-approved modification to a baseline or product.","Implement via Direct & Manage Project Work; update baselines through Perform Integrated Change Control.",[[pmp/200-process/298-change-control]],draft,Y
Artifact,gloss-artifact,A,"We keep key artifacts visible and versioned.","An artifact is any project work product (document, model, code, test result).","High-value artifacts should be accessible and under configuration control.",[[pmp/300-people/340-empower]],draft,Y
Assumption,gloss-assumption,A,"We log assumptions so we can test them later.","An assumption is a factor accepted as true for planning without full proof.","Assumptions breed risk; track them and validate early. Don’t confuse with constraints.",[[pmp/200-process/280-risk]],draft,Y
Assumption log,gloss-assumption-log,A,"The assumption log becomes our early-warning system.","An assumption log records assumptions and constraints with owners, dates, and follow-ups.","Living input to risk management; exam may ask where it’s created/updated.",[[pmp/200-process/280-risk]],draft,Y
Audit (quality),gloss-quality-audit,A,"A quality audit exposes gaps we can fix before the customer finds them.","A quality audit is a structured review to confirm project activities comply with policies and procedures.","Expect outputs like recommendations and change requests; not the same as inspection.",[[pmp/200-process/270-quality]],draft,Y
Authority,gloss-authority,A,"Clear authority prevents stalls and rework.","Authority is the legitimate power to make decisions and commit resources.","Exam loves sponsor vs. PM authority boundaries; escalate when decisions exceed your authority.",[[pmp/300-people/320-lead-team]],draft,Y
Accuracy (vs precision),gloss-accuracy,A,"We need accuracy first; precision without truth misleads.","Accuracy means results are close to the true value; precision means results are close to each other.","If asked to choose, pick the one that meets customer’s acceptance criteria (often accuracy).",[[pmp/200-process/270-quality]],draft,Y
