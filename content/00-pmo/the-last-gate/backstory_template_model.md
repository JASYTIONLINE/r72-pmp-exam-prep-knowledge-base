## ðŸ”§ How to Use [Name]â€™s Backstory
Explain how this backstory should be **used in story development** â€” not as exposition, but as a pressure system that drives decisions, hesitations, behaviors, and growth. Include notes about emotional tone, character tension, or hidden truth.

## ðŸ§  [Name]â€™s Backstory (In-World Truth)
Write a full narrative of their backstory **as if it's canon** â€” not a resume. This is what really happened, even if no one knows it yet. Give emotional stakes, key past events, and how they got where they are when the story begins.
