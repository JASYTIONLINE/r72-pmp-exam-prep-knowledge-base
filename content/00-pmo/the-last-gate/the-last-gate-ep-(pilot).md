## 36-Scene Outline (one LIners)

### 1. Ordinary World: 
#### 1a Riya monitors oxygen reports, drinks terrible coffee, and avoids eye contact with her reflection.
#### 1b She flags a CO₂ anomaly in the \[\[#Issue log|Issue log]] and gets excited about nothing.
#### 1c She stares out into space, remembering the incident she never talks about — not since the goats exploded. Her HUD flashes red;

### 2. Call to Adventure
#### 2a. CST broadcast: catastrophic system failure, all PMs presumed dead.
#### 2b. Her HUD flashes red; she's reassigned as Project Lead for ELIXIR.
#### 2c. She opens the file and finds Grex’s final note: “Don’t trust the Gate.”

### 3. Refusal of the Call
#### 3a. Riya tries to decline the assignment, but her resignation is processed as a coffee order.
#### 3b. The Risk Register cheerfully logs her emotional hesitancy as a compliance anomaly.
#### 3c. She reboots her desk twice, then accepts the role with dead eyes.

### 4. Meeting the Mentor
#### 4a. Riya accesses Grex’s audit logs and sees disturbing logic gaps in Gate decisions.
#### 4b. A dormant AI reactivates: JASYTI, the mentor no one can pronounce (she calls him Jazz).
#### 4c. JASYTI cryptically confirms: “The system is not broken. It is obedient.”

### 5. Finding Allies
#### 5a. She reactivates Dom (scheduling tyrant), Taz (chaos agent), and Nabler (smiling doom-planner).
#### 5b. The team immediately questions her authority and competence.
#### 5cShe wins them over by canceling a pointless alignment review in under 30 seconds.

### 6. First Threshold
#### A new executive named S. C. Reep arrives, pushing a dozen feature expansions.
#### Riya blocks the first \[\[#Change request|change request]] — and the Gate flickers green.
#### Her team silently starts to believe in her again, even if she doesn’t.

### 7. Road of Trials
#### The \[\[#Backlog|backlog]] begins reordering itself recursively; Legal submits scope in Sanskrit.
#### The \[\[#Change Control Board (CCB)|CCB]] denies its own approval and blames Riya.
#### Scope Creep (S.C.) schedules an “Innovation Marathon” mid-deployment.

### 8. Approach to the Cave
#### During a routine \[\[#Planned Value (PV)|PV]] audit, Riya discovers oxygen is overbudget — someone must be spaced.
#### The Risk Register selects K. Luless, the CEO, citing “Influence: High. Contribution: None.”
#### The system begins airlock prep; Riya slams the override and screams, “DON’T!”

### 9. The Ordeal (The Sprint)
#### The Gate locks down: a Sprint is declared — a real-time, physical execution trial.
#### Riya and her team must sprint through systems under threat, solving failures as they move.
#### The Gate reads hard NO on project launch; Riya overrides — and the system complies.

### 10. Reward
#### The launch succeeds. No fatalities. Oxygen normalizes. Gate status: stable.
#### The Risk Register logs: “Morale adjustment: +14%. Unwanted executive removed.”
#### Riya finds Grex’s private log: “It wasn’t the Gate. It was me.”

### 11. Road Back
#### Corporate offers Riya a promotion, new title, and a larger oxygen budget.
#### She declines, files an unredacted \[\[#Lessons learned|Lessons Learned]] document, and forwards it to no one.
#### Her team follows her out of the room without a word. That’s the vote.

### 12. Resurrection & Elixir
#### The Gate blinks yellow on a non-critical system override — and doesn’t act.
#### JASYTI logs off, leaving only a final line: “Override granted: human.”
#### Riya sips her coffee. Still tastes like regret. But now, she drinks it by choice
