# Standards

## BLUF
This folder contains **templates and logs** that enforce consistency in documentation.  
Standards define *how we record* information so that history, risks, and lessons remain traceable.

## Contents
- [[60-risk-log|Risk Log]] — records identified risks, ECO mapping, responses, and status.
- [[40-change-log|Change Log]] — tracks structural/content changes (e.g., PMBOK 7 → PMBOK 8).
- [[70-lessons-learned|Lessons Learned Log]] — weekly retrospectives and improvements.

## How to Use
Use these logs as **living documents**: update regularly, version properly, and cross-link to ECO codes where relevant.  
These records serve both **governance control** and **portfolio demonstration** for future projects.
