# Project PMP PASS Creation Docs (Archive)

This folder is an **archive and portfolio showcase**, not part of the live [[pmp|PMP Study Site]].  
It preserves the **inception documents** that guided the creation of Project PASS PMP.  

These artifacts demonstrate how the project was initiated and controlled using **Project Management Institute Guidance and Standards** and the [[500-eco/index|PMI 2022 Examination Content Outline (ECO)]]  

They serve as a **reference for prospective employers** and as a **template for students** who may wish to copy the process when learning to manage complex projects.

## BLUF

Project PASS PMP was executed as an **adaptive (incremental + agile) hybrid project**.  
The documents here show how governance was applied step by step: from first intake questions through to a PMI-compliant Charter, Scope Statement, and Project Plan.  

This is a **practice project**: it reinforced the skills needed both to pass the [[pmp-exam|PMP Certification Exam]] and to lead real projects in professional environments.

## How to Use

This archive is **for demonstration and study purposes only**.  
It models how to set up a PMI-compliant project inception phase:

- Read in order: **Intake → Charter → Scope → Plan**.  
- Map each document to relevant [[500-eco|ECO tasks and enablers]].  
- Note how the **hybrid adaptive approach** (predictive structure + agile increments) was applied.  
- Use as a **portfolio sample** or as a **teaching reference** to replicate the process.
