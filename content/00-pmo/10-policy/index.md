# Policies

## BLUF
This folder holds the **non-negotiable rules** for Project PASS PMP.  
Policies define *what must be followed* at all times â€” including the **Single Source of Truth (SoT) rule**, locked numbering system, cadence requirements, and sponsor approval authority.

## Contents
- Project Management Institute Standards and Guidance
- Numbering Policy (100/200/300/400/500)
- Scope Integrity Policy (ECO alignment only)
- Thread Integrity Rules (recency wins, no inference, no hallucination)
- Cadence Policy (updates published before each class)
## How to Use
Read these policies first before drafting, revising, or publishing any content.  
If a task conflicts with policy, the correct action is to **pause and ask the sponsor**.
