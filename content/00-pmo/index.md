# Project Management Office (PMO)

## BLUF
This portal is the control center for this website and anchors all **governance and internal control documents** for JASYTI's PMI Compliant PMP Examination Prep Course and Project PMP Pass.

Where the lesson folders (100–400) teach the **ECO content**, this section ensures the project itself is managed in a **PMI-compliant way**.

This section provides the rules, workflows, templates, and inception docs that guided the creation of the study site.  
#### Use this area when you need to understand **how the project is governed**, not what is being studied.
