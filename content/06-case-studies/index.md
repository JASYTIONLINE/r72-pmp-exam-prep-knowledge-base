[[02-pmbok-6&7/6-pmbok/index]]## Case Studies (6 vs. 7 in Action) – Home
Case studies turn abstract concepts into actionable judgment. 

In this section, we analyze real project scenarios to see how PMBOK 6’s process-driven ITTOs and PMBOK 7’s principle- and value-driven guidance lead to different emphases and decisions. Each example is built to mirror the style of PMP situational items—where two choices can look “right,” but one aligns best with PMI’s intent. 

Here we practice reading a situation, identifying the relevant inputs, tools, and techniques, weighing constraints and stakeholder value, and selecting the *most right* answer. The goal isn’t memorization; it’s repeatable reasoning under pressure. 

This is where theory hits the road. Used together with [[05-theory-application/index|Theory Application]], [[00-gov-pmp/index|Test Prep & Tactics]], the [[04-lifecycle/index|Project Management Lifecycle]], and the standards in [[02-pmbok-6&7/6-pmbok/index|PMBOK 6]] / [[02-pmbok-6&7/7-pmbok/index|PMBOK 7]], these cases help you connect standards to outcomes, strengthen your logic, avoid traps (like jumping to execution before authorization or managing risks reactively), and stay focused under pressure. By applying what you’ve studied across all four companion sections, you should be able to diagnose **what the question is really testing** and **choose the most right answer** with confidence.
