# Examination Content Outline (ECO) Index

## BLUF
This folder holds the **core PMP Examination Content Outline (ECO)** anchors.  
It is the **backbone** of the site — every lesson in `/100`, `/200`, and `/300` maps back to one or more ECO **Tasks and Enablers**.

Use these files to:
- Trace lessons upward into ECO anchors.  
- See the ECO broken into **Domains → Tasks → Enablers**.  
- Jump sideways between domains for integrated study.

The three domains: [[510-domain-1-people|people]], [[520-domain-2-process|process]], and [[530-domain-3-business-environmetn|business environment]] isn’t just an exam content outline framework — it comes alive through the Shawpe Lifestyle Centre story woven across these pages. From the first sparks of team conflict to the pressures of budgets, inspections, and shifting regulations, you’ll follow a project manager navigating real challenges while anchoring every step to the PMP domains. To experience the journey, begin with [[510-domain-1-people|people]] and see how the story unfolds through [[520-domain-2-process|process]], and [[530-domain-3-business-environmetn|business environment]], tying the exam outline to the reality of project management in action.
