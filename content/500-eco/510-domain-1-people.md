## 1.1 Manage Conflict  
At Shawpe Lifestyle Centre, conflict was inevitable. To interpret the source and stage of the conflict (1.1.1) means naming both what the fight is about and how far it has gone. Two chefs clashed over basil—fresh vs. dried. The project manager saw the true source was fragile supply lines, not taste, and that the stage was early enough to resolve. Like spotting smoke before a kitchen fire, the small flare-up could be contained.  

Next, he had to analyze the context for the conflict (1.1.2). Opening week pressure, late deliveries, and personal pride all shaped the moment. By naming these factors, he helped the team see the storm they were in.  

Finally, he evaluated and reconciled the appropriate conflict resolution approach (1.1.3). The chefs agreed to a limited menu based on what could be supplied reliably. Like rewriting a recipe with the ingredients you actually have, the compromise worked. And with conflict cooled, the project could move forward.

## 1.2 Lead a Team  
Once tempers settled, leadership took center stage. To set a clear vision and mission (1.2.1) means giving the team a north star. The PM told everyone: “Open Shawpe Lifestyle Centre on time and with pride.” That clarity was like a compass, keeping daily effort pointed in the same direction.  

But a diverse team needs more than vision. To support diversity and inclusion (1.2.2) means ensuring every perspective is heard. The PM invited café staff, trainers, and contractors into planning. Like mixing spices, the blend of voices made the final product richer.  

To value servant leadership (1.2.3) means enabling others by clearing roadblocks. The PM secured permits so electricians could keep wiring. Like a gardener watering plants, he created the conditions for growth.  

Of course, one style did not fit all. To determine appropriate leadership style (1.2.4) means flexing to context—directive during safety inspections, collaborative in design sessions. Like a conductor shifting tempo, the PM adjusted to the rhythm of the moment.  

He also had to inspire, motivate, and influence (1.2.5). When the gym floor was finished, he celebrated loudly, sparking energy across the team—like ringing a victory bell at halftime.  

Next, he analyzed team members’ and stakeholders’ influence (1.2.6). Inspectors held authority but showed up rarely, while foremen shaped daily work. Like mapping rivers and dams, he saw where influence flowed.  

Finally, he distinguished leadership options for different people (1.2.7). He coached juniors, negotiated with city hall, and empowered foremen. Like a chef choosing the right knife for each cut, he tailored his approach to fit the task.

## 1.3 Support Team Performance  
With leadership in place, the PM turned to sustaining performance. To appraise performance against KPIs (1.3.1) means checking work against set measures. At Shawpe, inspection pass rates and delivery timeliness were tracked weekly. Like checking a patient’s pulse, KPIs revealed team health.  

To support and recognize growth (1.3.2) means celebrating development. When a young carpenter earned certification, the PM praised him in front of peers. Like pinning a medal on a soldier, recognition strengthened morale.  

To determine an appropriate feedback approach (1.3.3) means matching tone and timing. The PM used quick comments for small fixes and monthly reviews for big lessons. Like seasoning a stew, the right touch at the right time improved the dish.  

And he verified performance improvements (1.3.4) by checking results. After repeated safety training, inspection failures dropped. Like seeing new shoots after pruning, the team’s progress showed growth was real.

## 1.4 Empower Team Members and Stakeholders  
Next, the PM focused on empowerment. To organize around team strengths (1.4.1) means assigning tasks to natural talents. One electrician excelled at diagrams, so she took on schematics. Like giving the sharpest knife to the best hand, the match paid off.  

To support accountability (1.4.2) means making sure everyone owns their work. At Shawpe, tasks were clearly assigned—like labeling pots on a stove so no dish was forgotten.  

To evaluate accountability (1.4.3) means checking ownership holds steady as work shifts. At milestones, the PM reviewed assignments. Like a coach checking the roster before kickoff, he confirmed all positions were covered.  

Finally, to bestow levels of decision-making authority (1.4.4) means pushing decisions down when possible. Foremen could adjust sequencing without waiting for approval. Like giving a sous-chef permission to season the dish, it sped progress without sacrificing control.

## 1.5 Ensure Team Members and Stakeholders Are Adequately Trained  
Training was the next frontier. To determine required competencies (1.5.1) means identifying skills essential for success. At Shawpe, food safety certification was non-negotiable for café staff. Like sharpening knives before service, training made performance possible.  

To determine training options (1.5.2) means choosing the best learning methods. The PM arranged workshops for compliance and peer coaching for customer service. Like blending classroom and kitchen practice, the mix built confidence.  

To allocate resources for training (1.5.3) means dedicating time and budget. The PM scheduled a half-day drill for staff. Like pausing a rehearsal, it ensured the performance would run smooth later.  

And to measure training outcomes (1.5.4) means checking that knowledge sticks. Staff passed quizzes and mock inspections before opening. Like taste-testing soup before serving, the PM confirmed readiness for launch day.

## 1.6 Build a Team  
A project this ambitious needed more than individuals; it needed a team. To appraise stakeholder skills (1.6.1) means identifying what each person brings to the table. At Shawpe, the PM discovered one carpenter excelled at finish work while another thrived on framing. Like tasting ingredients before cooking, he checked quality before combining them.  

From there, he had to deduce project resource requirements (1.6.2). Opening a Lifestyle Centre meant needing trainers as much as construction crews. Like balancing salt with heat in a recipe, the PM recognized both people and tools had to be present in the right measure.  

Finally, he continuously assessed and refreshed skills (1.6.3). As new equipment arrived, the PM arranged demos so staff learned safe use. Like sharpening knives throughout service, the team stayed effective and ready.

## 1.7 Address and Remove Impediments, Obstacles, and Blockers  
Even the strongest team stumbled if obstacles blocked the path. To determine critical impediments (1.7.1) means spotting what could halt momentum. At Shawpe, a missing permit threatened to delay the pool opening. Like noticing a clogged drain before the sink overflows, the PM flagged it early.  

Next, he had to prioritize which obstacles to clear first (1.7.2). Electrical inspections outranked landscaping because without power, nothing else could proceed. Like removing the biggest rock from the path before the pebbles, the PM focused effort where it mattered most.  

Then he used networks to remove blockers (1.7.3). The PM leaned on city hall contacts to accelerate the permit process. Like calling the maître d’ at a crowded restaurant, relationships opened doors and kept the project moving.

## 1.8 Negotiate Project Agreements  
No project runs without agreements. To analyze the bounds of negotiation (1.8.1) means knowing what can and cannot shift. At Shawpe, the PM entered vendor talks with firm budget ceilings. Like a chef at market, he knew which ingredients were non-negotiable.  

He then assessed priorities and objectives (1.8.2). For Shawpe, opening day readiness outweighed furniture aesthetics. Like choosing reliable knives over decorative ones, function came first.  

To verify objectives are met (1.8.3) means checking signed terms against needs. After contracts were inked, the PM confirmed delivery timelines matched the schedule. Like tasting a dish after seasoning, he ensured promises matched results.  

To participate in negotiations (1.8.4) means taking the lead in discussions. The PM personally handled supplier meetings, shaping fair outcomes. Like a captain steering into harbor, he guided the ship instead of drifting.  

Finally, he determined the right negotiation strategy (1.8.5). For gym equipment, he ran competitive bids; for specialized wellness gear, he built partnerships. Like knowing when to haggle and when to invest in trust, he tailored tactics to context.

## 1.9 Collaborate with Stakeholders  
Strong agreements meant little without collaboration. To evaluate engagement needs (1.9.1) means recognizing who needs what level of involvement. At Shawpe, investors wanted monthly dashboards, while trainers needed daily updates. Like tailoring a suit, the PM sized interactions to fit each stakeholder.  

He then optimized alignment (1.9.2). Members wanted early gym access; sponsors wanted visibility. By opening the gym first, he met both. Like aligning gears in a clock, stakeholder needs and objectives meshed smoothly.  

Finally, he built trust and influence (1.9.3). By delivering small wins and honoring commitments, the PM earned credibility. Like a baker known for never burning bread, consistency gave him the influence to steer harder decisions.

## 1.10 Build Shared Understanding  
Even with trust, misunderstandings crept in. To break down the situation (1.10.1) means tracing confusion to its root. At Shawpe, contractors argued over missed deadlines until the PM traced it to unclear blueprints. Like peeling an onion, he stripped layers until the truth was visible.  

Next, he surveyed all parties to reach consensus (1.10.2). Designers, builders, and owners were brought together to agree on revisions. Like tasting soup as it simmers, each input adjusted the flavor until it balanced.  

Once they agreed, he supported the outcome (1.10.3). The PM documented changes and distributed them widely. Like pinning the recipe on the kitchen wall, he ensured no one strayed from the new plan.  

Finally, he communicated to ensure common understanding (1.10.4). The PM translated technical updates into visuals for sponsors. Like sketching plays in the dirt before a football snap, he made sure everyone saw the next move clearly.

## 1.11 Engage and Support Virtual Teams  
Not everyone could be onsite every day. To examine virtual team member needs (1.11.1) means recognizing barriers like distance, culture, and tools. At Shawpe, some designers worked overseas, and the PM ensured they had video access to walkthroughs. Like opening a window in a closed room, visibility connected them to the work.  

To investigate alternatives for virtual engagement (1.11.2) means testing ways to connect people despite distance. The PM rotated meeting times to share time zone burdens and piloted new collaboration tools. Like passing the talking stick around a circle, it guaranteed each voice was heard.  

Finally, he implemented options for engagement (1.11.3). Weekly video demos let remote designers show progress and gather input. Like lifting the lid on a simmering pot, the team could see—and smell—the results together.

## 1.12 Define Team Ground Rules  
A team’s culture is shaped by its rules. To communicate organizational principles (1.12.1) means making shared expectations explicit. At Shawpe, the PM emphasized safety, respect, and accountability. Like posting house rules in a café, these guided daily behavior.  

To establish an environment that fosters adherence (1.12.2) means reinforcing the rules until they stick. The PM modeled respectful debate and highlighted safe practices. Like setting the thermostat, he kept the atmosphere steady so people stayed within bounds.  

And when someone slipped, he had to manage and correct violations (1.12.3). A contractor who skipped a safety check was called aside and coached back on track. Like correcting a sour note in rehearsal, the quick fix kept the whole performance in tune.

## 1.13 Mentor Relevant Stakeholders  
Leadership isn’t just about managing—it’s about teaching. To allocate time to mentoring (1.13.1) means deliberately setting aside moments to guide others. At Shawpe, the PM spent afternoons coaching junior staff on project documentation. Like watering seedlings, the steady care paid dividends later.  

To recognize and act on mentoring opportunities (1.13.2) means seizing the moment when someone needs help. When a foreman struggled with the new scheduling software, the PM sat down to show him shortcuts. Like handing down a family recipe, the lesson empowered someone else to succeed.

## 1.14 Promote Team Performance through the Application of Emotional Intelligence  
Finally, sustaining performance required empathy. To assess behavior through personality indicators (1.14.1) means noticing patterns in how people react. At Shawpe, one worker thrived on praise while another needed detailed instructions. Like knowing which plants need sun and which need shade, the PM adjusted his care accordingly.  

To analyze and adjust to emotional needs (1.14.2) means flexing leadership as moods shift. Before opening week, stress was high, so the PM added humor and encouragement. Like opening a window in a stuffy kitchen, the fresh air helped everyone breathe easier and perform at their best.  

With the team aligned, trained, and motivated, the stage was set to shift from *people dynamics* into *process execution*. The next challenge was how to deliver scope, schedule, cost, and quality with the urgency the Shawpe project demanded. → [[D2-process|Continue to Domain 2: Process]]
